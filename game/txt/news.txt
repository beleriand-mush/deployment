& admin definition
+==== NEWS ADMIN DEFINITION =================================================+
The administrators of this MUSH are the ones who work both in the cultures
and on a global level to keep this MUSH running as smoothly as possible and
to support players to make RP as easy and interesting as possible for them.
The admins on the MUSH do their work voluntarily, they do not get paid for
their work. They work as admins here simply because they want to improve
the environment that they play in themselves, and their only reward is to
see that their work is successful, or of course a pat on the back from
others who appreciate their work.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN CONDUCT)
+============================================================================+
& admin conduct
+==== NEWS ADMIN CONDUCT ====================================================+
Beleriand admins of all levels are expected to set the example for proper
conduct in our community. From the longest tenured Wizard to the newest of
newbie helper Culture Support admins we all share a duty to act in a
manner that is ethical, constructive, friendly and above all in a way that
serves the best interests of the Beleriand community. Players will look up
to you, seeing in you an example of proper behaviour in Beleriand, both IC
and OOC. It is essential to remember this, that others will follow the
path you mark. A good admin inspires confidence, trust, and a desire to
keep in mind the common good of the MUSH.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN CONDUCT 2)
+============================================================================+
&admin conduct 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN CONDUCT 2 ==================================================+
It is worth taking a moment here to talk a little about interaction with
players. Admins must remember that they have a tremendous amount of
authority and control over the MUSH lives of the Beleriand players. When
dealing with a player in an official capacity it is vital that admins
demonstrate a professional demeanor that should include patience,
consideration, courtesy and above all a spirit of public service, rather
than a display of arbitrary power. These are people on the other side of
the terminals. Remember that and remember the Golden Rule when you are
dealing with them.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN DUTIES)
+==========================================================================
& admin duties
+==== NEWS ADMIN DUTIES =====================================================+
There are some basic duties and responsibilities that are common to all
admins, no matter if they are global or cultural admins. The most important
guidelines for admins are summarized here, so if you are an admin,
please follow these guidelines, all of them are important.

Your main task on the MUSH is to facilitate RP and to make the MUSH in
general as easy and as interesting as possible for all players. Please
understand that though you should have fun with your work, you do your
work for the players. Most other guidelines here are directly derived from
these rules.

Try to set a good example for the players. This means that you should try
to act like you would expect it from a good player.

No matter which admin rank you have, please never forget, though your
position gives you special powers, you are also still a player on the MUSH,
so treat all other players or admins on lower levels like you would
expect to be treated by admins on a higher level yourself.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN DUTIES 2)
+============================================================================+
& admin duties 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN DUTIES 2 ===================================================+
Try to be as helpful as you can, especially with newbies. Please try to
understand that new players often don't know anything about MUSHs, so do
not get angry at them if they ask the same question two or three times.

Also, try to make newbies feel 'at home' here. When they page you, please
try to take some time for them. It often takes new players a lot of courage
to page someone for the first time, and if you are the first person they
page, and the only answer they get is, 'I don't have any time for you',
then you might also be the last person they page.

Try to keep track of the bulletin boards and policy changes when they are
being announced.

Please tell the admins on the higher levels about all problems,
suggestions, ideas and complaints that you might have. They want and need
your input. And if you receive input from admins on lower levels, consider
it carefully and do not just ignore it.

But never forget: Have fun with your admin work. The moment that you notice
that you can not have any fun as admin anymore is probably the moment that
you should give it up, though hopefully it will never come that far.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN DUTIES 3)
+============================================================================+
& admin duties 3
+==== NEWS ADMIN DUTIES 3 ===================================================+
To summarize the duties of the admins on Beleriand, please remember the
following: 1) As an admin you have a duty to keep the needs of the players
and the game foremost in your mind. 2) The safety of the MUSH is
paramount. 3) You must conscientiously fulfill the durites and
responsibilities that are assigned to your position. 4) You are a player
as well as an admin, so have fun and enjoy yourself. These duties will be
made easier if you strive to always be aware of the most current policies
governing Beleriand and work to enact those policies fairly and equitably.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RESPONSIBILITIES)
+============================================================================+
& admin responsibilities
+==== NEWS ADMIN RESPONSIBILITIES ===========================================+
Whatever area you are posted to handle, you should be aware that it is
given to you both as a privilege and an obligation. It matters not if you
are a Wizard or a Royal or a Culture Admin, you have a task to perform and
if you cannot then it is your duty to say that you can't. What we cannot
afford above all is stagnation; the game cannot afford for anyone to take
on jobs and tasks that they cannot do. Whatever the reason is, for the fact
that a job or a task cannot be done it is yours to keep for yourself,
there's no shame in saying that you cannot handle a certain task and you
need not tell why. In fact, if you show that you yourself know when it is
time to let go of a task, then all the more credit to you for being so
clear in perceiving that this work shouldn't belong with you. Speak to a
higher rank admin about it and that admin will surely provide you with
assistance.  Don't cling to something you know you can't handle.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RESPONSIBILITIES 2)
+============================================================================+
& admin responsibilities 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN RESPONSIBILITIES 2 =========================================+
On the other hand, there's no point in giving up too early either! Try, and
try again. When it becomes clear after you have tried your best, then why
not ask for some help? We are all in it together and none of us are capable
of doing EVERYTHING there is to do. We have our weak sides, so let's help
each other and improve. In a way, admins are the ones to benefit the most
from MUSHing, we learn more then the players ever will. We see all the
facets and all the dark and light sides of people and of MUSHing. We are a
privileged few... Know when to go calling on your superiors.  If a problem
arises that you have not encountered before (even though you may guess well
at how it should be handled), investigate into the matter and  before any,
BEFORE ANY, action is taken to repair the situation, please ask your fellow
admins at your own level if something like this has happened before and
what was done then. We are supposed to be fair and our judgments
consistent. If there's no one to ask, or if there hasn't been a mention of
this before, then drop a line to one of your superiors about the problem.
If the solution is urgent and the problem has to be taken care of at once
and you have none to ask, then you are on your own. Use your best common
sense and try your best. Be ready to give an account of what you thought
and how you reasoned, as well as what solution you applied to the problem.
Your superiors are not without understanding, far from it, they know what
you're going through. They've been there themselves you know.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN LEVELS)
+============================================================================+
& admin levels
+==== NEWS ADMIN LEVELS =====================================================+
There are two groups of admins on Beleriand: Cultural Admins (CA) and
Global Admins (GA). These groups are subdivided into several ranks. For
information about these groups and the admin ranks, read the following news
files:

Cultural Admins: NEWS ADMIN CA
Global Admins:   NEWS ADMIN GA
+============================================================================+
& admin ca
+==== NEWS ADMIN CA =========================================================+
There are six different cultural admin positions. It is left to the culture
wardens to fill these positions or not. Players can be on more than one
position, and there can be more than one player on all positions except the
CW and CV positions, and all CAs would always do some CS work. It is left
to the culture wardens to redefine the tasks and responsibilities that come
with the admin positions in their cultures, though if they do so, it is
their duty to inform the other CAs of their decision, otherwise the
following definitions will apply:

Culture Warden (CW):
The culture warden is the manager or governor of a culture. The CWs make
all decisions about theme in their cultures, they have to approve
tinyplots, they appoint or remove other cultural admins in their cultures
and appoint them to their tasks. It is the CW's task to make it clear to
the CAs what is expected of them, and it is the CWs task to communicate as
much as possible with the CAs and the CAs have to communicate as much as
possible with their CWs. The CWs are also the only ones who can decide
which players get the password for their cultural builder character. It is
also left to them to decide if a player can be a member of their cultures
or not. The GAs will not interfere with the CWs' decisions unless there
are, in the final opinion of the GAs, very good reasons.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN CA 2)
+============================================================================+
& admin ca 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN CA 2 =======================================================+
Culture Vice Warden (CV):
The vice warden has the full rights of the warden if either there is no
warden in the culture, or the warden is not available for a longer time,
for example when the warden goes on vacation, but if this is the case, then
either the warden or the global admins will explicitly ask the vice warden
to act as warden till the warden returns. To let others know that the CV is
acting as temp CW, it is suggested that CWs set the vacation flag on
themselves when they have to leave the MUSH for a longer time. If the CW is
available, the CV will basically have the same rights and tasks as a normal
CA, and might even have another CA position (i.e. CC, CB, CT or CS).
Usually however, the CV will be the most important counsellor for the CW.

Culture TP coordinator (CT):
The TP coordinator's task is to come up with TP ideas or to collect them,
submit them to the CW for approval, plan the TPs and coordinate them when
they are running. One note: It does not mean that nobody else can work on
TP ideas if there is a CT in a culture. All players should always be able
to come up with TP ideas, in which case the CT would be there to offer help
and counsel.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN CA 3)
+============================================================================+
& admin ca 3
+==== NEWS ADMIN CA 3 =======================================================+
Culture Coder (CC):
The culture coder codes and maintains the local code on the ZMO. For that,
the CC should usually be able to modify the ZMO. The CC would also be the
one to code objects that might be needed for RP in the culture, or it would
at least be the CC's task to supervise the work on these objects, and
assist the players who code them when they need help.

Culture Builder (CB):
The culture builder not only builds things in the culture, but also
supervises the building work of others, and assists where help with
building is needed. The CB usually knows the password of the builder
character.

Culture Support (CS):
The culture support admins do the day-to-day admin work, they mostly
culture new players and help them. The CS rank is not really a lower rank
than CC, CT, CB and CV, all the other admins, even including the CW, would
do CS work too, they just have additional responsibilities.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN GA)
+============================================================================+
& admin ga
+==== NEWS ADMIN GA =========================================================+
The global admins usually don't involve themselves in cultural affairs, but
maintain the MUSH itself. There are two different 'ranks' for global admins
which differ mostly in the powers they have.

Wizards: The wizards can not only examine but also modify every object
(including players) on the whole MUSH. It goes without saying that the
wizards should use their powers wisely.

Royals: The powers of royals are more limited, they basically have a subset
of wizard powers. They can examine all objects, but cannot modify them
unless they control them, and they can teleport anywhere. They also do not
need money, and are not affected by quotas. Though they are not as powerful
as wizards, they should still use their powers responsibly.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT)
+============================================================================+
& admin advancement
+==== NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT ================================================+
This section describes how a player becomes an admin, and how players can
move up from one level to the other. Everyone should keep in mind, that
being an admin is a responsibility and not a reward, and gaining admin
positions or advancing to higher admin positions is not the purpose of this
game. If you become an admin, it should be to work for the MUSH and the
players, but not to achieve power over others. Usually, the admins who have
to appoint other admins will notice if a player is doing exceptional work,
and then promote the player. A good rule of thumb is that people should be
promoted to a position when they are already doing the work for this
position, though there are other factors that have to be considered, for
example how well the new admin would fit into the existing admin team.

There are basically four different admin 'levels' to which a player can
advance: Cultural Admin, Culture Warden, Royal and Wizard.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 2)
+============================================================================+
& admin advancement 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 2 ==============================================+
When a Culture Admin (CA) is to be appointed, the suggestion will go to the
Culture Warden (CW) and the cultures CA staff, so they can all agree that
the player should be raised to CA status in their culture. An ordinary
player may be appointed CA if he shows a will to contribute, shows the
online time, the engagement and has contributed in a special way to the
gain of the culture. To what position is of course based on need and the
suitability of the particular player. It is possible to have several CA's
of the same type, more then one Culture Coder (CC) for instance. A Global
Admin is appointed by the GA's, choosing a player who has shown
him(her)self to be able to handle the MUSH topics in some special way, that
player often is expert at some area to which he is appointed to handle. One
does not apply to become one, one may be recommended by others to become GA
or picked by the GA's and offered the chance to become one.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 3)
+============================================================================+
& admin advancement 3
+==== NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 3 ==============================================+
Cultural Admin:
The cultural admins (CV, CC, CT, CB and CS) for a culture are appointed
(and removed if necessary) by the culture warden of this culture. The CWs
are totally free in their decisions, though it is suggested that they talk
to their CAs before they appoint another CA, to make sure that the CAs will
be able to work together as a team.

Culture Warden:
The culture wardens are appointed only by the global admins, though they
will of course listen to the opinions of the CAs in the culture. Usually,
the CV will be the first choice when the CW spot has to be filled, though
the GAs can also choose someone else.

Royal:
The wizards and royals vote on new royals.

Wizard:
The wizards vote on new wizards.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RESOURCES)
+============================================================================+
& admin resources
+==== NEWS ADMIN RESOURCES ==================================================+
Among the Global Admins (GA's) there are people who have been appointed
especially for deep and solid knowledge in the fields of, Theme, Combat,
RP...etc.. Make use of them! (-Admins gives you their specialities) Give
them a page with any kind of question, or better yet, first use the channel
that is assigned to the topic you are wondering about. You may get what you
want that way, it's not all that hard to do and it saves the GA's a bit of
work. They are there for you but that doesn't mean they ain't without
things to do. When in doubt, page a GA.  Another service that the game
provides MUSHwide are the ARBITERS, led by the Archarb's. They are assigned
to solving combat RP and theme issues as judges in disputes. You have the
right to consult one at anytime concerning an issue you may have. Be
prepared though, it may take some time for a final decision, for often the
ARB will need (and want) to consult with others.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RESIGNING)
+============================================================================+
& admin resigning
+==== NEWS ADMIN RESIGNING ==================================================+
This can occur if you as an admin are inactive, if a admin behaves wrongly
and won't respond to correction, if an admin abuses his privileges, or if
an admin cannot handle his job. It does not matter if it was by intent or
not if the admin does not change after repeated warnings. Removing an admin
from a post is something that no one is pleased about; it is not a plesant
thing to do. A thing that hopefully never needs to be done. But it will be
done if needs be for the best of the MUSH! There is no excuse not to pay
heed to warnings which have been received repeatedly, any admin will first
be asked why and what he is doing in a nice way, what then is heard will
perhaps lead to a kind warning, then a more severe warning, followed by a
final word. Then, demotion. The stability of the MUSH is paramount, we are
here for the MUSH and it's hundreds of players...not for the amusement of
the admins. Complaints from any Admin who deems himself being treated
unfairly will be listened to and examined, just as any player's complaints
will be examined as well.

Type NEWS ADMIN <topic> for information.
+============================================================================+
& admin zones
+==== NEWS ADMIN ZONES ======================================================+
Note: this is an admin level topic and involves some coding knowledge.
      If you are not an admin and this makes no sense to you, don't worry
      about it.  If you are a local admin but don't work with coding in
      your area, you also don't need to worry about it.

PLAYER ZONES:

Every player has a "zone" which is set automatically for them when they
join a culture; the "-culture" command takes care of this.  The zone is
actually a regular object in itself, commonly called a "Zone Master Object"
or ZMO. For details on what zones are and how they work, see "HELP ZONE
OBJECTS". We will assume here that you know what ZMO's are, and how to put
attributes and locks on objects.

Our cultural ZMO's have multiple purposes.  One use is a place to code
"local" commands which are only available to members of a particular
culture.  Coding at this level is performed at the discretion of the
admins of the particular culture.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN ZONES 2)
+============================================================================+
& admin zones 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN ZONES 2 ====================================================+
An important usage of player zones on Beleriand is to provide some
information about a culture to the system, for use by the various "global"
commands. Every culture MUST have a cultural ZMO.  The following things
need to be done to  make an acceptable cultural ZMO:

*) The ZONE LOCK on the ZMO needs to be secure.  The zone lock would
   normally include the CW of that culture, and perhaps a couple
   of other people trusted with building and coding culture-wide.  It is
   possible but not required that all the LA's for that culture will
   be on the lock. It is also possible to have no one at all on the
   lock (ask a wizard to help with this if necessary).

*) The attribute NEWBIE_TITLE *should* be set on the ZMO.  The value of
   this attribute will be put in a players &TITLE attribute when they
   are -culture'd.  If this attribute does not exist, the title will
   default to "Citizen".

(continued in NEWS ADMIN ZONES 3)
+============================================================================+
& admin zones 3
+==== NEWS ADMIN ZONES 3 ====================================================+
*) The attribute NEWBIE_WELCOME should be set on the ZMO.  The text in
   this attribute will be displayed to a player when they are -culture'd.
   The message should give give the new player a few hints to get started,
   such as the name of a local help command.  It needs to be fairly short
   though for the benefit of players with small terminals, no scrollback
   etcetera.  Maximum length of 20 lines (78 chars per line).

*) The attribute NEWBIE_HOME should be set on the ZMO.  This value needs
   to be the dbref# of the room where you want new members of the culture
   @link'ed for their initial home location.  Players will be
   automatically @link'ed to this room.  Typical locations would be a
   "barracks" or "guest room" or somesuch.

   IMPORTANT:  The NEWBIE_HOME room must *also* have its zone set to the
   cultural ZMO.  This might be different than all the zones for all the
   rest of the rooms in the culture, but is done as a safety check to
   make sure that players don't get linked to a room which doesn't belong
   to their culture.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN ZONES 4)
+============================================================================+
& admin zones 4
+==== NEWS ADMIN ZONES 4 ====================================================+
*) The attribute CULTURE_CHANNEL should be set on the ZMO.  This value
   is the name of a -com channel which the player will automatically
   be joined to when they are -culture'd.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING)
+============================================================================+
& admin recruiting
+==== NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING =================================================+
First of all it should be said that recruiting should not be a competition
between the cultures. Try to find out if a new player will really be happy
in your culture, or else we might lose new players from the MUSH when they
find out that they are not having fun. It will help your culture more to
show new players how to join another culture where they might be more happy
and where they will RP, than dragging newbies into your culture when this
is not the place where they can find the RP that they were looking for.
This does not mean that you can't try to make your culture look good, but
the helpful recruiter will usually be the most successful recruiter, even
if being helpful means that you have to help newbies who decide to go to
other cultures. Helping new players will always pay off in a way, no matter
if the new players join your culture or not.

Also, try to be patient. On a MUSH, it is not 'The early bird catches the
worm', but 'The early recruiter scares them off'. Please don't page newbies
before they join the <Newbie> channel, unless they page you and ask for
help. Many new players are very insecure at first when they join a MUSH,
and it might scare them off if they get a lot of pages right after they
connect, especially since they might not know how to page yet. Also, when
they are on the <Newbie> channel, try to be polite and not too spammy.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 2)
+============================================================================+
& admin recruiting 2
+==== NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 2 ===============================================+
Anyone can understand a player/admin wanting to recruit more people for his
culture. Every culture should advise it's players on how the correct ways
of recruiting are done.   First of all, be very patient. To a newbie this
is very confusing stuff, try and add as little as possible to that
confusion. If there are other players talking in the same room please page
them (so as not to disturb the newbie) and try and get them to understand
that spam is not what the newbie needs. Clear, concise, precise answers. Be
gentle and warm towards him/her, no point in being anything else. And DO
NOT brag and boast about your culture (Your culture might be wonderful but
don't irritate and offend with your views, instead impress and ask the
newbie to come see for him/herself instead), HELP the newbie find a home,
ANY home, in which he/she can be happy.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 3)
+============================================================================+
& admin recruiting 3
+==== NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 3 ===============================================+
There is absolutely no point in recruiting someone that will be unhappy
with your culture. Far better to talk awhile to the newbie and try and
figure out what the newbie really wants to do here...what kind of character
he wants to play and what race, what he/she would like to do in
Beleriand... and so on. The newbie doesn't need a sales rap, he needs HELP!
Confusing newbies is a good way to get tagged as a troublemaker, don't try
and recruit newbies if you know you have a problem being clear in what you
say...  As an admin of your culture you are to look out for people who have
a known trouble recruiting newbies and restrain those efforts and redirect
their energies. Your culture gains by it, the MUSH gains by it. Be gentle,
for the players that are trying to recruit only wants the best for the
culture, even if they fail.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 4)
+============================================================================+
& admin recruiting 4
+==== NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 4 ===============================================+
This is what you should do, or something that's close to this when a newbie
comes on and doesn't know what to do. LISTEN first, ALWAYS listen to the
newbie.  Ask if he/she needs some help or information, that you are willing
to help out should he/she want it. Ask if he/she has any cultures in mind
to join. If the newbie doesn't want help, leave him/her alone with the
offer to talk anytime, especially about your home culture. IF he/she is
uncertain about what to do, talk some more about what the newbie wishes to
do on Bel, what type of race and character he/she wishes to play. Try and
find out his/hers interests and skills. If you find he likes beards, loves
axes and hates orcs recommend the newbie to become a dwarf. You get the
picture? Don't try and sweet-talk the newbies, support them and enlighten
them on what your home culture is, what the possibilities are there and by
all means, be friendly and very patient. If they want to talk about the
rest of Bel then do so. We are players on the MUSH first and foremost. When
the MUSH gains a new playes so do we, if we get one to our culture then
double is the joy.

(continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 5)
+============================================================================+

+==== NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 5 ===============================================+
If the newbie wants to join then bring him/her to your home and show
him/her around. Tell the newbie about the regular help and -help files, the
local help-files, about the -mail system (be sure he/she at least
understands how to access it thru -help -mail) and also about the bulletin
boards. (And how to access those...-skim, -read and so on. The local-BB,
Public-BB are the most important.) Try to spread this information out, ask
him/her how long time they have and give the information piece-meal. Ask
them to write it down. Tell the newbie that if he/she does want to join
they'll have to wait until a CA can -culture them. Warn them that they will
not be able to participate in any IC events until they have (either done
these things that are listed here or fulfilled your cultures own list of
things to do) made a desc for themselves, made up a background story
(neither of these need be very long but both has to be approved of by a CA
before the newbie can go RP) and they have to find a suitable job.

must be treated delicately...it's worth more than gold. If you as a culture
are to live on you have to rely on new players to come in. Good newbie help
is thus VITAL! Imagination, creativity...come on! Make your newbie help
more than 3 pages of dreary looking information...don't bore the newbie
into quitting the game. Bind his/her interest fully with fun and
interesting things to do...offer them plenty of choices, make their entry
into the game as smooth as you possibly can. Helping newbies is the number
one priority! Try and understand them and for the best of the MUSH, try and
spread good ideas around. This is not the time to sit back and enjoy bright
ideas inyour own culture, we will benefit on the whole, by gaining more
players all over the MUSH, rather then getting only the tenth player that
happens to find it's way to your great idea. Share! If all do the same,
then there will be a time when a newbie can come online and with a little
bit of energy be RPing as a full player inside a few days time!

Beleriand's Arbiters (Arbs) are players entrusted to safeguard and govern
matters of Theme and Combat. They are our judges, chosen because they have
displayed in-depth of knowledge of the Silmarillion and others of Tolkien's
works, as well as superb RP skills and familiarity with realistic combat.
Besides being responsible for teaching combat RP and testing new players
for combat registration, the Arbs must also be ready to mediate and solve
player disputes when called upon to do so.  An Arb should be called
whenever a dispute related to Theme or Combat RP arises and can not be
solved by the players involved in a peaceful manner.  Once summoned, the
Arbs expect full cooperation from the players involved in the dispute, and
their final decision must be respected and adhered to by all.  If such a
matter extends beyond a minor RP dispute into a more serious issue, the
Arbs will conduct a more thorough and careful investigation which could
last days or even weeks before announcing the decision.

In order to improve the quality and consistency of the MUSH, we have some
building guidelines which we insist that everyone adhere to. Construction may
be inspected by the admins, and you may be required to rebuild (or even
destroy) work if it does not meet approval. You should always have admin
approval before creating any new rooms or exits.

The following subtopics are available:

+===============================================================================+
& building descriptions
+==== NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS ===============================================+
Guidelines for Good Descriptions

It's hard to say what constitutes a perfect description, but here are some
general guidelines and rules which you should try to adhere to:

*) Most importantly, your descriptions should describe what a player *sees*.
   It should not convey information that the character cannot determine by
   looking around - neither the player nor the character is psychic.

   It also should not try to think for the player, or dictate what the player
   would feel in that spot.  Provide the cues - but let the player decide how
   to act on them.  Remember that the way a character might react to something
   may depend a lot on their species or culture!  An orc's idea of art may
   be an elf's idea of grisly horror.

*) Avoid words which convey little information, particularly generic adjectives
   like "beautiful", "ugly" and so forth.  Instead, provide vibrant details
   which help the player to feel like he is really there.  "You are in a
   beautiful garden" is not as good as a description which mentions the
   bright red roses, the little fragrant purple blossoms on the vines
   going up the walls, and the white marble fountain in the center.

(continued in NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 2)
+===============================================================================+
& building descriptions 2
& building descriptions2
+==== NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 2 =============================================+
*) Use good English. Avoid colloquialisms. Check your spelling.  Bad language
   and misspelling become irritants if you have to see them every time you
   pass through a room.  More significantly, many of our players are not
   native English speakers, and can be severely confused by grammatical
   errors or just overly colloquial phrasing.

   Have players who are known for good descriptions proof your work and
   offer advice.  It's very hard for anyone to judge their own writing.

*) As a general rule, avoid putting the descriptions of NPCs into the
   descriptions of rooms and exits.  If you are describing a busy location
   such as a marketplace, you might mention the general hubbub and that
   many folk are present, but you should not go so far as to describe
   individuals present.  You may wish to create a puppet to put in the room
   if you want to have an NPC which stands out from the crowd.

(continued in NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 3)
+===============================================================================+
& building descriptions 3
& building descriptions3
+==== NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 3 =============================================+

*) Don't use the ANSI color codes in your descriptions.  You can use the
   'hilite' attribute if you want, but use it sparingly. If you do use
   highlighted text (boldface), put the highlighted phrase in quotation
   marks as well, for the benefit of those people who are not set ANSI.

   The reason for avoiding color is that even if the player's terminal
   supports ANSI and COLOR, you don't know what the actual colors are.
   (Just because the MUSH calls a color "red" for example doesn't really
   mean it's going to be red on everyone's screen: the ANSI control code
   really means something akin to "select color 3", and there is no absolute
   mapping of color numbers to colors).  Also, depending on what a player
   uses as their background color, you could end up with text displayed in
   the same foreground and background colors (effectively just looking like
   colored blocks on the screen).

*) Don't use tabs "%t" for formatting - people can have different tabstop
   settings and what works on one terminal won't look right on another.

(continued in NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 4)
+===============================================================================+
& building descriptions 4
& building descriptions4
+==== NEWS BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 4 =============================================+
*) Use blank lines to separate paragraphs in long descriptions.  Don't
   indent paragraphs though.  This is really just a stylistic convention
   we have adopted for this MUSH; other ways are equally valid but we
   ask you do it this way on this MUSH.

*) Don't make any assumptions about the width of the player's terminal -
   in particular, don't try to line things up in columns by inserting spaces
   and depending on where the line wraps.  If you are doing something which
   really needs to have tabular data (that is, text aligned in columns),
   then force line breaks by including "%r" in the text, and limit the
   width of individual lines to 78 characters (79 in a pinch, but never use
   80 because some terminals will automatically wrap when you print in
   column 80 whereas others only wrap when you try to print the 81st character.
   This results in things which look right on some terminals coming out
   double-spaced on others.)

(continued in NEWS BUILDING EXITS)
+===============================================================================+
& building exits
+==== NEWS BUILDING EXITS ======================================================+
There are four basic attributes which any properly done exit will have:

*) All exits MUST have an @OSUCCESS and @ODROP.

   The @OSUCCESS and @ODROP messages should enable people in the room to follow
   behind you easily, or know where you arrived from.

*) All exits SHOULD have an @SUCCESS and @DESCRIBE as well.  If an exit is
   set TRANSPARENT, then it must have an @DESCRIBE.  It is very confusing
   to see "You see nothing special." followed by the description of a room.

   For outdoor locations, the @SUCCESS message should provide a hint to the
   player about how far or long they have travelled, to aid them in working
   out their IC travel time.

*) Do NOT put an @ODESCRIBE on an exit.  This just generates useless noise
   which everyone has to see whenever a player looks at an exit.

& building exits2
+==== NEWS BUILDING EXITS 2 ====================================================+
--- Exit naming and aliases ---

This is a controversial area, and opinions differ widely.  Nonetheless, we have
adopted a particular style and expect everyone to adhere to it.  We do not do
this because one style is inherently better than another, but simply to
maintain a certain level of consistency across the MUSH.  Our guidelines and
requirements for exit naming are:

*) Exits should have a "full" name and normally should also have one or more
   aliases.  The "full" name is what the player sees when he looks around the
   room.  It should be complete words.  The exit may have any number of
   "aliases" as well, these are additional names for the exit which are
   separated from each other by semicolons ";".  As an example:

       @name <exit> = Oak Door;Out

(continued in NEWS BUILDING EXITS 3)
+===============================================================================+
& building exits 3
& building exits3
+==== NEWS BUILDING EXITS 3 ====================================================+
*) Case is not significant to the MUSH parser (you can use upper- or lowercase
   to go through an exit), but we do use capitalization to provide hints about
   alias names.  If you take all the capital letters from the full name of the
   exit, this should be one of its aliases.  Hence, for the above example we
   should actually have:

       @name <exit> = Oak Door;OD;Out

*) Exit aliases should include any "obvious" short forms for the full name.
   If an exit name is multiple words, then usually the first word alone should
   be a valid alias.  To continue with our example name, "Oak" and "Door"
   are probably good aliases:

       @name <exit> = Oak Door;Oak;Door;OD;Out

(continued in NEWS BUILDING EXITS 4)
+===============================================================================+
& building exits 4
& building exits4
+==== NEWS BUILDING EXITS 4 ====================================================+
*) Compass directions should always include the obvious abbreviations:

      Northeast;NE  North;N  Northwest;NW  West;W
      Southwest;SW  South;S  Southeast;SE  East;E
      Up;U          Down;D

   You do not need to capitalize the second part of compound compass
   directions in the full name of an exit.  In other words, just use
   "Northeast" and not "NorthEast".

*) If there is an obvious main exit from a room, or only one exit for
   for a room, then it should include the aliases "Out;O".

(continued in NEWS BUILDING EXITS 5)
+===============================================================================+
& building exits 5
& building exits5
+==== NEWS BUILDING EXITS 5 ====================================================+

*) Avoid exit names which match MUSH commands, or common abbreviations for
   MUSH commands.  In particular, avoid the following abbreviations for exits:

      P,PA  B,BR  L,LO, I,IN

   The reason for this is that these are also abbreviations for commonly
   used MUSH commands (PAGE, BRIEF, LOOK, INVENTORY) and the MUSH command
   interpreter matches commands you type against exit names before MUSH
   commands.  If for example you type "LO" to look around, you'll go
   through the "LO" exit instead!

   "IN" is an unfortunate case, since it seems to be a perfect complement
   to "OUT".  Avoid it just the same.

(continued in NEWS BUILDING EXITS 6)
+===============================================================================+
& building exits 6
& building exits6
+==== NEWS BUILDING EXITS 6 ====================================================+
*) If you have an exit alias which is not derivable from the rules described
   previously, then include the alias name in angle brackets "<>" as part of
   the full name:

        @name <exit> = Oak Door <Gate>;Oak;OD;Gate

   In fact, the above example is not sufficient.  If you have a full name
   which includes an alias in "<>", then you must also provide an alias
   which is the full name without the part in "<>":

        @name <exit> = Oak Door <Gate>;Oak Door;Oak;Gate;OD

   The reason for this is that if the player were to type the full phrase
   "Oak Door", it would not work if you didn't include the alias, because
   the name for the exit was "Oak Door <Gate>" and the MUSH parser will NOT
   automatically recognize "Oak Door" as an abbreviation!  The MUSH parser
   is inconsistent in this regard, since other commands like "GET" certainly
   *do* match partial strings.

*) Do NOT include an alias name in "<>" if it's an "obvious" abbreviation.

(continued in NEWS BUILDING ROOMS)
+===============================================================================+
& building rooms
+==== NEWS BUILDING ROOMS ======================================================+
*) All rooms MUST have a description.  Normally this is in the @DESCRIBE
   attribute.  There is one special case where you might have the attribute
   in the @SUCCESS attribute instead, see NEWS BUILDING TIP 1 for details.

*) If you set the AREANAME attribute on the room, this name will show up
   as your location when a player does a "-who".  The "-who" (and other
   commands) will first check for an AREANAME on the room itself, and
   then on the ZMO for that room.  Normally AREANAME is only set on the
   ZMO, but you might find it convenient to override it with a local
   ARENAME on the room.

*) All rooms should be set TRANSPARENT, unless there is a good reason not
   to. What happens when a room is set TRANSPARENT is that the exits are
   shown with the name of the room they lead to. This makes it easier for
   newbies, as well as not so newbies, to find their way around. However,
   there may be reasons that this format may not fill the needs of the
   builder, for what he is trying to create. In that case, it is left to
   the discretion of the CW of the culture if it is used. But in general,
   it is a good convention to follow for the reasons above.

+==== NEWS BUILDING TIP 1 ======================================================+
TIP:  Making a room description which is different for a person in the room
      versus a person looking through an exit into the room.

Usually, when looking through a tranparent exit, you are trying to see who
is in the target room, and not the full description of the room itself.
Here's a building trick for you which makes this easy to do, based on the
following two items:

   If you have @DESCRIBE and @SUCCESS on rooms, a player in the room will see
   both the @DESC and @SUCC messages (in that order).

   If you have TRANSPARENT exits looking into a room, then when a player
   looks through the exit, they will see only the room's @DESC.

Put the room's description in the @SUCC instead of the @DESC attribute.
Then, players looking through an exit into the room will not see the
room description, but players in the room itself will.  In the description
for the exit itself you can put a shortened description of the target room.
Players looking through the exit will see the short description (which is
really the exit's description but will look like the target room's
description instead), followed by the contents of the room.

The command -HELP will list the game-wide commands unique to this MUSH.
Please familiarize yourself with these commands, especially -mail. Most of
these commands are either aids to RP or coding, or are designed to provide
information on things around the game or different ways of communication.
+============================================================================+
& coding puppets
& puppets
+==== NEWS CODING PUPPETS ======================================================+
Puppets are objects which represent animals, non-player-characters, and
other similar sorts of creature.  Usually these objects have the PUPPET flag
set, so that they relay what they see and hear to the player who owns them,
though for the purposes of this discussion that is not a requirement.

Puppets are allowed on this MUSH, with some restrictions:

1) Puppets cannot be used as combatants, except by special admin approval.
   Players may RP combat (or anything else for that matter) with puppets
   if all parties agree (for example, several elves could fight with a warg
   puppet).

2) As a general rule, animals should be considered "ordinary" - your dog or
   horse is a typical member of the species.  Animals should not "talk" or
   exhibit overly intelligent behavior, nor do they have psychic links to
   their owners. In particular, puppets may not be used as spy objects.
   What you see through the eyes of a puppet is not to be considered IC
   information. Use common sense when deciding what an animal can do - no
   matter how well you've trained it, a falcon isn't going to fly 500 leagues
   and pick a random person out of a crowd to deliver a message (on the other
   hand, a trained homing bird might legitimately travel between two fixed
   locations).

(continued in NEWS CODING PUPPETS 2)
+===============================================================================+
& coding puppets 2
& puppets 2
& coding puppets2
& puppets2
+==== NEWS CODING PUPPETS 2 ====================================================+
3) Puppets which represent pets should be limited to fairly "standard"
   sorts of domestic animals, like dogs, cats, horses, etc.  They should
   certainly be chosen as something appropriate to your culture.  If you
   want to step outside these bounds, make sure to clear it with an admin.

4) Puppets should not be used in lieu of real characters.  For example, if
   you need to send a messenger from one culture to another, send an actual
   player if at all possible.  Puppets should be used as general NPCs only
   by special approval.

5) Puppets may be used for NPC guards and sentries, heralds, or other forms
   of "static" character.  Usually these are set up by your local admins and
   are part of the local "scenery" of the location you are in.

   If you are travelling and encounter such a puppet (like a sentry), you
   should try to determine what culture or player that puppet belongs to,
   and how to interact with it.

+===============================================================================+
& coding puppets 3

+==== NEWS CODING PUPPETS 3 ====================================================+
6) With the exception of items like sentries, you should make sure to put any
   puppets you have away before logging off.  If you have a horse, you should
   stable it.  If you have a dog, you probably should just pick it up before
   you disconnect.  Don't leave your pet just sitting in a room, especially
   if that room is a high-traffic area!

   You may find it useful to include commands in your @ADISCONNECT which will
   @teleport a puppet of yours back into your inventory automatically when
   you disconnect.

7) If you have a pet, RP it!  Don't just pull it out of your pocket as an
   occasional prop when you aren't otherwise noted for having one.  For
   example, unless you normally wander around with your hunting falcon, you
   shouldn't just suddenly have a hunting falcon when it's convenient.

The primary purpose of the combat system is to act as an impartial judge
between a group of two or more players engaged in combat RP. The combat
system is by NO means a substitute for Role-Play. In fact while combat RP
does not require using the combat system, role-play is essential when using
the combat system. Beleriand is not a Dungeons and Dragons simulation. The
game is most fun when poses are vivid and descriptive, using the results of
the combat system as a cue to guide the direction of role play. Players who
fail to role play while they use the combat system will be ruled against in
any arbitrating decision and may have their combat privileged taken away.

descriptive poses, while the Coded System is not expected to take a
predominant role in combat scenes. Despite this, players should always use
their -training and stats as a measure of their character's skill and prowess
in combat situations, whether the Coded Combat System is used in the scene or
not. Ideally, a player's -training and stats should reflect their character's
IC role in the culture, as well as their past combat experience. If two
players can not agree on their relative fighting prowess while doing RP-only
combat, CS -training and stats will be used as the default measure of their
characters' skill. An available ARB could also be called to the RP if the
players involved in the scene want an impartial judge to settle their combat,
but feel that the CS would not properly accomodate their IC situation.

The list of current resources: ARROWS COINS HERBS LEATHER ORE WOOD are part
of a Basic Resource System in which materials for weapons and armour are
used when these things are forged. It is a unit-less system designed to

& combat stats
+==== NEWS COMBAT STATS ========================================================+
A brief primer on what the individual stats mean to your character, in
alphabetical order:

CONstitution - This indicates the general health and 'well being' of your
character. A higher constitution value means your character will heal from
wounds faster. In addition higher CON might mean battle wounds are less
hindering.

DEXterity - The 'speed' of a character. This stat affects your ability to
avoid being hit by a foe's weapon while increasing ability to hit the foe back.

INTelligence - Effects how quickly your character can learn and be -trained.
In addition how high and in how many weapons a player may have high training
in.

STRength - Quite obviously, how strong a character is. How hard they hit and
how much they can carry.

MAX-HP - An indication of how much damage a character can receive. MAX-HP can
only be adjusted by Admins.

n-AC - Natural-AC. An indicator of the ability of the species to resist harm
from weapons.

+===============================================================================+
&combat beasts
+==== NEWS COMBAT BEASTS =======================================================+
Beasts are coded objects designed to interact with players in regards to the
Combat System on Beleriand, they range from such things as Guards of all
species to animals and monsters. These Beasts are available to the cultures
and, if a player has a good reason, to the players themselves. This however
is usually not the case as control over the Beasts is rather tight to avoid
manipulation of said objects. Direct ownership will be restricted, where it
is practical Culture Admins might get control over it for the sake of
simplicity.

Beasts are there to fill out the IC world and make it more real to interact
with, to create the illusion of the players interacting with other people
then just the players themselves. Hunting a Stag, scaring up and being
attacked by a Bear, running afoul of a dread Spider...In some cases, Beasts
may be created as 'background' for characters. Beasts are in all just the
'supporting cast' in this play we call Beleriand and as such, will not
compete with the true 'stars'. A Beast will not ever be as important as a
player and will not be more then a player, unless we are speaking Dragons or
something. Beasts are not there to give others a edge, they are there
because it would make sense to have them there/here in the IC world of Tolkien.

In general, requests should go through the Culture Admins first, then to
the ArchArb/Other Wr's with a clear definition of the purpose of the Beast/s,
reasons and useages.

& combat faq test
+==== NEWS COMBAT TEST =========================================================+
Q: How do I get combat approved?
A: Every player is required to pass a basic combat test to prove they are
familiar with the combat system, and capable of RPing combat in a
realistic, thematic manner. This test is split into two portions: The
written, and the Role-Played. Players can take the written portion of
their combat test from the Auto-Arb machine in the Library, which is
located just off the OOC Hangout. The written test answers should be
-mailed, along with a copy of the questions, to the Combat Tester(s) in
the player's own culture. The Combat Tester will then contact the player
to arrange a time and date for the Role-Played Portion of the Combat Test.
Players who have already become Combat Approved with their primary
characters, but wish to approve their alts should -mail an ARBiter with
the request.

+==== NEWS COMBAT TEST 2 =======================================================+
Q: What is the test like?
A: The Fighter Test is consists of two sections: The written quiz, and a
roleplayed combat scene. The written part is made up of questions designed
to test the player's familiarity with the NEWS COMBAT and -help combat
files, as well as questions regarding the basics of Beleriand theme. The
second part of the combat test is usually held in one of the OOC Combat
arenas, and consists of an entirely roleplayed scene involving combat. It
is the Combat Testers' job to decide whether the player has the necessary
RP skills to handle combat believably and thematically, and to hopefully
offer suggestions on what the player can do to improve these skills.

+==== NEWS COMBAT TEST 3 =======================================================+
Q: How is the test graded?
A: The player taking the Roleplayed combat test is carefully evaluated by
the Tester giving it. It is the Tester's responsibility to decide whether
the player is in fact ready for the FIGHTER flag by gauging their ability
to RP combat thematically and realistically, and by determining if the
player is familiar enough with the OOC rules and etiquette of combat RP to
merit receiving the FIGHTER flag. A Tester pays attention specifically to
the player's ability to visualize the RP scene, their feel for timing
concerning their own actions in relation to others around them and the IC
world itself, their sense of how possible it is to hit and to wound in the
situation at hand, what and how much damage to take from a likely blow,
and what kind of movements are possible or impossible in armour of
different types and in varying conditions. It is the Tester's duty to help
the player improve in these areas by offering advise and suggestions
during the test, or possibly by recommending that the player take combat
lessons on the subject in which they are lacking. If the Tester feels that
the player is not sufficiently skilled in combat RP, or not familiar
enough with basic MUSH theme and combat etiquette, the FIGHTER flag will
be denied and the player will be urged to take combat lessons either from
any available -trainers or from other players of their own culture.

(continued in NEWS COMBAT FAQ TRAINING)
+===============================================================================+
& combat faq training
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ TRAINING =================================================+
Introduction:
Over time, training increases your skill at using a weapon. All facets of
combat: ability to hit, accuracy and even defensive skills all are improved
with training. We endeavor to have training RP'd between student and trainer.
This allows the trainer to not only give some tips on weapons usage, but also
to display some good RP abilities and make sure the students ability to
project movements with words is improving. Some FAQ's:

Q: Who can I train with?
A: Any approved trainer who has greater skill in the weapon you wish to train
in. In general it should be a player in your culture, although if it happens
that another culture's trainer is nearby, it is okay if s/he agrees ICly to
train you. Going out of your way to find a trainer in another culture is
frowned upon. Being trained by a known IC enemy is even worse and will likely
result in both players losing privileges. If no trainer characters are available
in a player's general IC area for an extended period of time, it may possible to
hold training sessions in the OOC Combat Arena with an available -trainer, and
only if permission is granted by the player's Cultural admins.

(continued in NEWS COMBAT FAQ TRAINING 2)
+===============================================================================+
& combat faq training 2
& combat faq training2
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ TRAINING 2 ===============================================+
Q: How often may I train?
A: In theory, every couple of RL days a player may improve skills by training.
This depends on the students INTelligence. Those with average INT (100) will
benefit with -train's every few days, while those with more may train faster,
and likewise, those with less will need to wait more. Overall, staying active
with training sessions every six days with average intelligence will improve
one word level per RL month.

Q: Word Level? Huh?
A: The -training command will show you the current 'word levels' of your skills
in each weapon. These are in fact textual descriptions of a -range- that your
training falls into. Each 20 training points represents another word level, and
while you may not directly see the number of training points you have, each
successful -train does indeed improve your skills towards the next word level.
See "-Help Combat T L" for an illustration of Word Levels.

+===============================================================================+
& combat faq training 3
& combat faq training3
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ TRAINING 3 ===============================================+
Q: How many weapons can I -train in?
A: With the same limitations on waiting a couple of days between -training
sessions, you may train in any number of weapons available to you and your
culture. There is a limit, however, in how skilled you may become in multiple
weapons. While Expertise in Longsword and Bow is attainable over time for the
average player, expertise in three or more weapons is hardly possible. This
again depends on INTelligence, and the frequency of the player's -training
sessions.

Q: How may I become a trainer?
A: Trainers should firstly be excellent RPers and active to the point where
they can at least arrange training sessions with fellow players. It is up
to each culture's admins to choose who is capable of being a trainer in each
culture. It is hoped the above conditions apply of course. The game admins
will only become involved if there is a problem with the trainer.

(continued in NEWS COMBAT FAQ HEALING)
+===============================================================================+
& combat faq healing
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ HEALING ==================================================+
Q: Who can use the -heal command?
A: While anyone may use the -heal command, only authorized healers who represent
those with IC skill will have a reasonable chance of success. Whether it is
successful or not, the -heal command can only be used on a given player once
per IC-day.

Q: What stats affect the chances of a -heal working? And how much healing will
occur?
A: The skill of the healer and the CONstitution of the character who the heal is
used on are the greatest factors. In addition, the healers INTelligence and some
random factors play into both the chances of success and the amount (measured in
HP's) the player will increase by. There's one caveat: A healer must be in at
least fair health to be able to use the -heal command. Currently that number is
half of the healer's total HP's.

+===============================================================================+
& combat faq healing 2
& combat faq healing2
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ HEALING 2 ================================================+
Q: How do I become a healer?
A: Express the desire to your Culture Admins. Likely you will begin as an
apprentice, both in skills and position. After some time, you'll be a full
fledged healer with a good idea how to RP your important job.

Q: How does a healer improve his or her skill?
A: With each successful heal attempt, the healer gains a small amount of skill.
Over time, this increase can lead to higher word levels and abilities in
healing. Possibly in the future, highly skilled healers will be able to impart
healing skill based on some kind of training command.

Q: Are there other ways to heal?
A: Yes. Even without the aid of a healer, a player will begin to naturally
recover on the following IC day from when s/he was last attacked by anyone. In
general, such a recovery occurs much more slowly than under the care of a
skilled healer.

(continued in NEWS COMBAT FAQ DAMAGE)
+===============================================================================+
& combat faq damage
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ DAMAGE ===================================================+
A brief primer on how the combat system works:

A numbered 'range' is calculated for each player. It is a number greater
than 0 and is a function of each of the players DEXterity and training in
the weapon they currently wield. The exact weighting for this number is
not quite settled on, but for now training points contribute somewhat
less than DEXterity in this figure. In addition a 'reach' number is
calculated for the attacker. This number again is a function of the players
training points and DEXterity. So that leaves us with these values:
          attack_range ... f(DEX,training)
          attack_reach ... f(training,DEX)
          defend_range ... f(training,DEX)
Now a random number is generated for each player between 0 and *_range for
each player. In the case of the attacker his/her number will be between 0
and MIN(attack_range, defense_range). If the difference in these two
numbers is less than attack_reach - this attack has resulted in a hit and
damage must now be calculated.

(continued in NEWS COMBAT FAQ DAMAGE 2)
+===============================================================================+
& combat faq damage 2
& combat faq damage2
+==== NEWS COMBAT FAQ DAMAGE 2 =================================================+
Now that we have a 'hit' number which is less than 'attack_reach', we can
use this number to calculate damages. Firstly the 'brunt' of the attack is
calculated as a percentage of the difference between 'attack reach' and the
'hit' number. This is multiplied by the damage of the weapon. Then the
damage is further multiplied by weighted values of the attackers STRength
and training. Finally it is divided by the defenders effective AC (armour
class)..which is in itself the defenders AC plus possible bonuses for
training.

So to try and put this in equation form:

hit = Rand(min(attack_range,defend_range) - defend_range))
damage = weapon_damage * (hit - attack_range) / attack_range
damage = damage * (f(attacker_STR) + f(attacker_training))
damage = damage / (defender_AC + f(defender_training))

(continued in NEWS COMBAT TESTERS)
+===============================================================================+
& combat testers
+==== NEWS COMBAT TESTERS ======================================================+
        Combat Testers are -trainers authorized to give the Role-Played
portion of Beleriand's Combat Test to players in their own culture. It is
their responsibility to test whether new players are familiar and
proficient enough with the etiquette and rules of Combat RP to receive the
Fighter flag. Upon applying for the RPd combat test, a new player should
contact his culture's combat tester(s) and arrange a time and date for a
RPd testing session.
        The RPd portion of the test is played out in the OOC Combat
Hangout, and is not usually considered In Character Role Play. The entire
testing session, including OOC commentary from the Combat Tester and
player, should be logged and saved.
        Afterwards, the Combat Tester should notify Beleriand's ARBiters
and the CAs of his culture to make note of whether the player passed the
RPd portion of the test, and to give some indication of what areas they
should practice and improve upon. Combat Testers are chosen and appointed
by their Culture Wardens.

Players           - Can have two weapons. The first training gives a bonus, so
                    that most players start in the Jr. Apprentice levels. A
                    Player can be -trained in one weapon about every 4 days
                    with an INT of 100.

+==== NEWS COMBAT VERSION ======================================================+
The code for the combat system was begun in November 1996. In January 1997
the code was changed and placed on Wizard level objects. After some delays,
and after moving Beleriand's site, the code was opened for public use around
March of 97. That was version 1.0, and like many so-called 'dot-ohs' it had
its share of bugs, which at this writing are fixed. The current version is
called 1.5, which is more a representation of other features which have been
added than any particular event or release. A brief history of those changes
and future versions follows:

Version  Date         Features
  1.0    March 97     Forging, wielding, attacking, healing...
  1.1    March 97     Bug fixes, encumbrance of weights
  1.2    April 97     Mostly internal changes
  1.3    April 97     Healing and training modified
  1.4    May 97       Attack command changes
  1.5    May 97       More weapons, resources code enhanced
  1.6    June 97      Shoot command (bows), limited 'beta beasts'
                      internal changes to forge
  1.7    October 97   Enhanced attack command hunting beasts.
  1.8    In Progress  Many enhancements and tweakings.
  1.9    Planning     More resources, resource objects
  2.0    Dreaming     Possible introduction of attack weight estimates.

THE GREAT HOUSES AND KINDREDS OF THE GONDOTHLIM

1. Mighy was the array of the house of the king and their colours were
white and gold and red, and their emblems the moon and the sun and the
scarlet heart.

[12.] Now in the midmost of these stood Tuor above all heads, and his mail
of silver gleamed; and about him was a press of the stoutest of the folk.
Lo! all these wore wings as it were of swans or gulls upon their helms, and
the emblem of the White Wing was upon their shields.

2. But the folk of Meglin were drawn up in the same place, and sable was
their harness, and they bore no sign or emblem, but their round caps of
steel were covered with moleskin, and they fought with axes two-headed like
mattocks. There Meglin prince of Gondobar gathered many warriors of dark
countenance and lowering gaze about him, and a ruddy glow shone upon their
faces and gleamed about the polished surfaces of their accoutrement.

3-4. And many other kindreds were there, the folk of the Swallow and the
Heavenly Arch, and from these folk came the greatest number and the best of
the bowmen, and they were arrayed upon the broad places of the walls.

3. Now the folk of the Swallow bore a fan of feathers on their helms, and
they were arrayed in white and dark blue and in purple and black and showed
an arrowhead on their shields. Their lord was Duilin, swiftest of all men
to run and leap and surest of archers at a mark.

4. But they of the Heavenly Arch being a folk of uncounted wealth were
arrayed in a glory of colours, and their arms were set with jewels that
flamed in the light now over the sky. Every shield of that battalion was of
the blue of the heavens and its boss a jewel built of seven gems, rubies
and amethysts and sapphires, emeralds, chrysoprase, topaz, and amber, but
an opal of great size was set in their helms. Egalmoth was their chieftain,
and wore a blue mantle upon which the stars were broidered in crystal, and
his sword was bent-now none else of the Noldoli bore curved swords--yet he
trusted rather to the bow, and shot therewith further than any among that
host.

both these kindreds were marshalled by Penlod, tallest of Gnomes.

7. There were those of the Tree, and they were a great house, and their
raiment was green. They fought with iron-studded clubs or with slings, and
their lord Galdor was held the most valiant of all the Gondothlim save
Turgon alone.

8. There stood the house of the Golden Flower who bare a rayed sun upon
their shield, and their chief Glorfindel bare a mantle so broidered in
threads of gold that it was diapered with celandine as a field in spring;
and his arms were damascened with cunning gold.

9. Then came there from the south of the city the people of the Fountain,
and Ecthelion was their lord, and silver and diamonds were their delight;
and swords very long and bright and pale did they wield, and they went into
battle to the music of flutes.

10. Behind them came the host of the Harp, and this was a battalion of
brave warriors; but their leader Salgant was a craven, and he fawned upon
Meglin. They were dight with tassels of silver and tassels of gold, and a
harp of silver shone in their blazonry upon a field of black; but Salgant
bore one of gold, and he alone rode into battle of all the sons of the
Gondothlim, and he was heavy and squat.

11. Now the last of the battalions was furnished by the folk of the Hammer
of Wrath, and of these came many of the best smiths and craftsmen, and all
that kindred reverenced Aule the Smith more than all other Ainur. They
fought with great maces like hammers, and their shields were heavy, for
their arms were very strong. In older days they had been much recruited by
Noldoli who escaped from the mines of Melko, and the hatred of this house
for the works of that evil one and the Balrogs his deoms was exceeding
great. Now their leader was Rog, strongest of the Gnomes, scarce second in
valour to that Galdor of the Tree. The sign of this people was the Stricken
Anvil, and a hammer that smiteth sparks about it was set on their shields,
and red gold and black iron was their delight. Very numerous was that
battalion, nor had any amongst them a faint heart, and they won the

were they ill-fated, and none ever fared away from that field, but fell
about Rog and vanished from the Earth; and with them much craftsmanship and
skill has been lost forever.

This was the fashion and the array of the eleven houses of the Gondothlim
with their signs and emblems, and the bodyguard of Tuor, the folk of the
Wing, was accounted the twelfth.

&languages
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES ===========================================================+
The language system on Beleriand might seem confusing at first, because it
does not only consist of 'pure' languages, but also of dialects, which can be
related to each other, and because a lot of language names appear in the
language list that do not appear in the Silmarillion. That is why these news
files were written, to explain the thematic ideas behind the language system
and to make it easier to understand how the languages can be used in RP.
When you read these news files, please understand that this has been a
controversial topic on Beleriand and has been discussed for quite some time
before the current language system was implemented. The current system
represents a consensus, and if you disagree with certain points, please keep
in mind that others might disagree with other points which might look
perfectly logical to you.

The languages on Beleriand can be divided into 6 categories. Read the
following subtopics for more information:
NEWS LANGUAGES COMMON                 NEWS LANGUAGES DWARVES
NEWS LANGUAGES ELVES                  NEWS LANGUAGES EVIL
NEWS LANGUAGES MEN                    NEWS LANGUAGES OTHERS
+===============================================================================+
&languages common
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES COMMON ====================================================+
The common language in Beleriand, the language that you speak when you
use the normal 'say' or 'pose' commands and not the language system
commands, is 'Beleriandic', which is a dialect of Sindarin. It can be
gathered from various sources that all species in Beleriand were able to
communicate with each other, and the most likely candidate for a common
language would be Sindarin. There are three other Sindarin dialects (as can
be seen in 'NEWS LANGUAGES ELVES') which are of course related to
Beleriandic, so everyone will also have skills in the three other Sindarin
dialects. There might be exceptions of course, people who would not be able
to speak Sindarin at all, and it will be left to you to RP such a character,
though you should speak to your CW and CV first to see if they think that
your decision makes sense.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES DWARVES)
+===============================================================================+
&languages dwarves
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES DWARVES ===================================================+
Not much can be said about the language of the Dwarves. Their only language
on this MUSH is Khuzdul which is not subdivided into dialects. It should
only be mentioned that the Dwarves were more secretive about their language
than all other species, and they usually did not teach it to anyone and did
not speak it in front of others too often.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES ELVES)
+===============================================================================+
&languages elves
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES ELVES ===================================================+
The elvish languages are probably the most complicated part of the whole
language system. It is probably clear to everyone that the Noldor would
know Quenya, and the Laiquendi would speak Nandorin, but Sindarin is
subdivided into three dialects (four if you count Beleriandic): Falathrin,
Mithrin and Iathrin. Falathrin is the dialect that is being spoken by the
people of the Falas, Iathrin is the dialect of Doriath and Mithrin is
originally the dialect that was spoken by the Elves of Mithrim, but which
was spread all over Beleriand later as the Noldor moved to their new realms
in the east and the south. All these dialects are related, so if you know
one dialect, you will also have some skills in the other dialects.

The dialect which is actually closest to Beleriandic, the 'common language'
of Beleriand, is Iathrin, because with Thingol claiming kingship over all of
Beleriand, it was probably the most important dialect in Beleriand before
the return of the Noldor. For more information on this topic, read 'NEWS
LANGUAGES COMMON'

Note: a small dictionary of common words in Quenya and Sindarin is
available.  See 'NEWS DICTIONARY'.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES EVIL)
+===============================================================================+
&languages evil
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES EVIL ======================================================+
The Orcs took words from all languages and used them in their own uncouth
language. There were probably different dialects from tribe to tribe, though
at the moment, we only have one language for the Orcs in the language system
here: Orkish

There is also a special language called Melkorin, which we consider to be
Melkor's 'corrupted' version of Valarin. This language would probably not be
spoken by a simple Orc, and will be given out on a case-by-case basis.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES MEN)
+===============================================================================+
&languages men
&languages humans
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES MEN =======================================================+
To find out how the languages of the Men would be related was easy, since
Beor himself gives us some exact information on this topic in the
Silmarillion. He said that his people (who lived in Dorthonion) were
sundered in speech from the Haladin (who now live in Brethil), but that the
language of the people of Marach (who went to Dor-lomin) is more like to
theirs. We decided to call the three languages Beorian, Halethian (for the
Haladin) and Marachian, with Marachian and Beorian being closely related.

There are two other languages for the Men: Eastron is the language of the
Easterlings, and Druic is the language of the Druedain.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES OTHERS)
+===============================================================================+
&languages others
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES OTHERS ====================================================+
There are two languages for restricted races: Eaglish for the Eagles and
Entish for the Ents. Though some might think that it would be more
appropriate to choose words in Sindarin for these language names, it was
decided that less confusing names would be chosen in these cases.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES TEACHING)
+===============================================================================+
&languages teaching
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES TEACHING ==================================================+
The language system on Beleriand allows language teachers to improve a
player's language stats by using the '-teach' command. There are several
important guidelines for language teaching though that each language teacher
should be aware of:

Language teaching should be RPed. There has to be some sort of IC language
lesson, or at least a longer IC meeting. Of course, doing a real language
lesson would be nearly impossible since hardly anyone would know too many
words of Tolkien's languages, especially the more obscure ones. It is left
to the language teachers to come up with ideas for their language lessons.
Some real life knowledge of languages can help here.

All language teachers should be familiar with the background behind the
languages they know (see 'NEWS LANGUAGES'). They should also have IC reasons
for knowing these languages.

(continued in NEWS LANGUAGES TEACHING 2)
+===============================================================================+
&languages teaching 2
+==== NEWS LANGUAGES TEACHING 2 ================================================+
Languages should not be taught to anyone without good IC reasons. Language
teachers who are approached by players for language lessons should ask these
players to make sure that their characters would really be inclined to learn
languages. It is not very 'in character' for a lot of characters to be
interested in languages at all. Language teachers should also ask themselves
if it makes sense to teach a certain language to a particular player.
Language teachers can always refuse to teach a player, and language lessons
should not be given out as favors, or to improve the language skills in the
teacher's culture, but only on a thematically reasonable basis.

In this section we'd like to note the existence of software 'clients' that
provide many features over so-called 'vanilla' Telnet programs. These are
programs that can be downloaded from sites on the Net for free or as shareware.

Some of the features include command editing, recall buffers, logging and
cut & paste abilities, and many, many others. Some of the better clients
available (with respective operating systems) are:

which is especially designed for uses with MUSHes and MUDs.  It offers a lot
of nice features, such as session logging, uploading mechanisms, macros,
command recall and editing, ability to switch between worlds for folks who
don't have windowing systems, "gagging", "triggering", etc.  If you are
running some variant of Unix or even OS/2, and can figure out how to download
and compile code, then check it out!  See http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/

& policy alts
+==== NEWS ALTS =============================================================+
It is possible for a player on Beleriand MUSH to acquire additional
characters beyond their initial Primary Character. These other characters
are known as Alternate Characters, or simply 'alts'. The possession of
Alternate Characters is considered highly acceptable and common, and in
many cases even encouraged, for it allows a player to maximise their
chances of finding activity on the MUSH, as well as provide a diversity in
roleplay and environment. When dealing with alts, the following rules
should always be respected:

 # A player may have up to four characters in total: that is, one Primary
Character and three Alternate Characters. These alts should only be
acquired on the basis of activity and genuine desire, and not simply for
the sake of having them. The actual procedure for creating a new alt is
described further on in this NEWS document. The exception to this rule are
Global Admins, who are allowed an additional alt for the purely OOC
purpose of performing their Admin duties.
 # All Alternate Characters should be registered in the MUSH's alt
database through the player's CW or the Alts GA.

 # A player should never have more than one character in a specific
culture. The exception to this rule are Reserved Race alts (see NEWS RC),
which may be in the same culture as another of the player's characters.
Both of these still count towards the total of four, however.
 # Players may have both their Primary and any and all Alternate Characters
logged onto the MUSH at the same time.
 # Two characters belonging to the same player should never interact ICly
under any circumstances. A player should keep their Primary Characters and
Alt Characters completely and utterly separate, and in the rare event that
IC interaction between them is being forced by circumstance, the player
should seek the assistance of their -locals, or failing that, the Alts GA
to ensure that the situation is rectified as soon as possible. Deliberate
failure or refusal to comply with this policy may result in deculturing or
purging from the MUSH.
 # If a player is a CW of a culture, their CW character must be their
Primary. There is no restriction on the possession of any other
administrative positions, however.
 # Only one of a player's characters may be a Feature at any time.

+==== NEWS ALTS 3 ===========================================================+
The actual process of creating an alt is as follows: A player who wishes to
acquire an Alternate Character should first speak with the CW of the
culture of their Primary Character. The CW should then send a -mail to both
the player and the CW of the culture that the player desires an alt in,
requesting permission to create the new alt. It is within the rights of
either CW to refuse a player an alt, so long as it is with good reason
(such as lack of activity on the part of the player), and if this is the
case, the CW(s) should sent a -mail to both the player and the Alts GA
explaining why the Alternate Character was refused. If the CW of the
culture in which the player desires their alt accepts, the player may go
ahead and create their new character, and the CW should add the player to
the MUSH's alt database and send a -mail to the CW of the player's Primary
culture and the Alts GA letting them know of the alt's acceptance and
creation.

In the instance of a CW being inactive or on vacation, the CV of the
culture is authorised to approve any new Alternate Characters. Failing the
presence of a CV, the other CAs of the culture may approve alts, so long as
they -mail notification to the CW/CV. If there are any confusions
surrounding this matter, the Alts GA should be contacted. It is also
advised that players applying for a Reserved Race in another culture gain
the consent of their CW in advance, just to ensure that no unpleasant
complications occur at a later date.

Players who have already registered any one of their characters for Combat
do not need undergo the Combat Test again on any of their alts. Instead
they should simply contact an Arbiter (-list arbiters full) or their local
Combat Tester (-tester) and request that the flag be granted to their
character.

You will not attempt to damage the database in any manner, or to use code
   in a way that will cause damage to the database or its host computer.
You will refrain from sexual harassment.
You will agree to the policies as set forth in our NEWS files.

In short, you will behave responsibly and sensibly, and not attempt to
undermine the hard work that the administrators and players have put into

& gender
& policy gender
+==== NEWS GENDER ===========================================================+
***  Gender and sexism: Out of Character

We should hope it would go without saying, but just to make it very plain:
sexism on the OOC level will not be tolerated.

*** Gender and sexism: In Character
The world described by Tolkien is basically a medieval fantasy setting. The
closest correlaries for real life societies are usually fairly "sexist"
societies, with men and women occupying fairly distinct niches within their
cultures (for example, medieval societies did not normally have female
warriors).  Hence, a truly "thematic" interpretation would likely leave us
with societies which have strong IC gender-biases, normally leaning towards
male-dominated societies.

(continued in NEWS GENDER 2)
+============================================================================+
& gender 2
& gender2
& policy gender 2
& policy gender2
+==== NEWS GENDER 2 =========================================================+
 *) The majority of players tend to play characters of the same gender as
    themselves.  Women players are not likely as a whole to want to be
    limited in their RP here though, or be forced to play a male character
    for the more "interesting" roles.

 *) Regardless of the gender of the player behind a character, it's a lot
    harder to have "interesting" female characters in male-biased
    societies.

Therefore:

Regardless of the thematic correctness of it, all of our cultures have no
gender bias.  The same IC roles and opportunities are available to male and
female characters.  You can RP a sexist chauvinist if you wish and perhaps
even make a good case that your are being thematic when you do so, but do
not complain if people refuse to RP with you as a result.

(continued in NEWS GUESTS)

& guests
& policy guests
+==== NEWS GUESTS ===========================================================+
You will often see guests online; you will know them by their name, which
is "Guest" or "BlueGuest" or something similar. Please treat them well, for
these are our prospective members, who may be interested in the MUSH! If
guests have questions about the MUSH and its workings, be sure to refer
them to our NEWS and -HELP files, or to an online admin.

Page them with greetings and how to page. Sometimes they will already know
how, but it is always best to assume they are not familiar with MUSH at all
and don't know how the commands work.

Do not ever try to recruit guests to your culture! Cultures are just a part
of the MUSH, and the guest has not even joined the MUSH yet (and won't, if
all it gets is recruitment propaganda)! Please, just give 'em a chance.

(continued in NEWS HARRASMENT)
+============================================================================+
& harassment
& policy harassment
+==== NEWS HARASSMENT =======================================================+
Harassment is not just a Real Life problem. As characters are played by RL
people, many RL problems sometimes occur. Here is our policy on harassment.

 IC vs OOC     As Role-Playing on Beleriand is strongly encouraged, it is
               to be expected that players will act differently when In
               Character.

               Out Of Character harassment of players as a result of IC
               conflicts is discouraged and a violation of the good conduct
               clause. Talk to a wizard if you experience problems.

This MUSH is for roleplaying, first and foremost. We recognize, however,
that there will be times when players wish simply to hang out and relax
with their friends. If you find yourself playing Beleriand solely to hold
OOC conversations, however, this might not be the place for you. Our
resources are valuable. Please consider moving your OOC chat to IRC or to a
social MU*.

Please do not inflict your OOC conversations upon people who are attempting
to role-play. If one person objects to OOC comments during role-play,
EVERYONE should desist. If you continue to make OOC comments during IC
role-play, you will be breaking the good conduct agreement. In general,
keep your OOC conversations either in the Hangout or other OOC area.

Please see -HELP MODE, -HELP HO, -HELP ME, and NEWS OOC DESCS.

We use the following guidelines for recycling of People, Places and Things:

  - If you plan to be away for a while but do wish to return and to have
    your character saved, set your ON-VACATION flag.

  - On the last day of the month, the Wizard in charge of purges will
    destroy any character of "None" culture who has not logged on at all
    throughout the previous month.

  - Culture Wardens should regularly remove inactive players from their
    culture at their discretion, but a good guideline is to remove at least
    players who have been inactive for over 90 days. -LAST/C is a good tool
    for this purpose.

  - When a character is recycled, so are all of his possessions and rooms.
    If he owns an important part of Beleriand (beyond personal rooms),
    those rooms and exits will be @chowned to the appropriate Zone Masters.

+==== NEWS RC DEFINITION ====================================================+
When a player creates a character for the first time, he or she is asked,
"Please do not use Tolkien names." Those characters named by Tolkien in his
books--characters such as Beren and Luthien, Celegorm and Curufin, Turin
and Glaurung and Mim--are known as Features.

Then, only a small selection of races--the most common races--is available
to new players. The other races--including Werewolves and Balrogs and Great
Eagles and others--are known as Reserved Races.

Characters of these categories are collectively known as Reserved
Characters. While their number is restricted, they are, indeed, available
for play, and these files explain matters collectively pertaining to them.
It should immediately be stressed that playing an RC is a priviledge, and
that certain duties come along with that priviledge.

(continued in NEWS RC DUTIES)
+============================================================================+
& rc duties
& reserved character duties
& policy rc duties
& policy reserved character duties
+==== NEWS RC DUTIES ========================================================+
While it may be said that part of what we do on Beleriand is to re-enact
the books, the true focus of our game is on the new stories of our own,
original characters who exist within the framework of Tolkien's world and
of Tolkien's characters as related in his books. Consider well, then.
Anything can happen to your own, original character, and he or she can do
whatever he wants. However, when you step into the shoes of an RC, the
character does not become your own. Rather, you are bound to dutifully play
the role true to Tolkien's vision of the character, and to ensure that his
or her story follows that in the original stories. You are part of the
essential framework of Tolkien's Beleriand. This is as true for characters
of Reserved Races--creatures of strange and fearsome powers--as it is for
Features.

In plain English: being permitted to play an RC role does not imply a
reward or the presentation of a special status, nor does it connote
official recognition as a good RPer, save insofar as one is suitable for a
specific role. For most players, an RC role is too restrictive and less fun
than playing an original character. Good RP is its own reward, and good
RPers will be known among their fellow RPers by their good RP.

+==== NEWS RC DUTIES 2 ======================================================+
RC roles in any given culture are made available according to a formula
which takes into account the total number of active players in that
culture. An RC player must therefore make it his primary duty to RP with
many other people as often as possible, spending a good majority of his
times not only IC, but actively RPing and creating RP for others. RC roles
are rare and coveted--be worthy of it. Since so much of the RP life of a
culture revolves around the RCs, an RC must notify their culture and any
others that may be affected if they will be absent from the MUSH for some
length of time and for any reason. While a prolonged absence or significant
drop in online time may require that someone else take over a book RC role,
this will be judged on a case by case basis and according to the need of
their culture.

There is also a very high standard for the OOC behavior of players of
Reserved Characters. While everyone is expected to be courteous to their
fellow players at all times, especially in public forums like the -com
system, this holds doubly true for players of RCs, who ought to take up
their roles with respect and dignity.

+==== NEWS RC ACQUISITION ===================================================+
If you are certain you wish to play a RC role, consult your culture's help
files and your culture admins to find out your local policy. The following
might be some helpful general guidelines.

It is best if you play your own character for a while--at least three
months--before aspiring to a RC role. This will help you to become familiar
with the game. Research well the character or race you wish to play.
Remember, it will be your responsibility to faithfully portray Tolkien's
world.

Let your CW know, humbly and straightforwardly and without nagging or
continual "subtle hints," of your desire. And understand that, while your
CW will keep your wishes in mind, he or she is not bound to any formal
application process which necessitates an ultimate approval or denial of
your request. Rather, if and when an opening comes up, at his or her
discretion, the CW may someday ask you if you are interested in filling a
given role.

(continued in NEWS RC AVAILABILITY)
+============================================================================+
& rc availability
& reserved character availability
& policy rc availability
& policy reserved character availability
+==== NEWS RC AVAILABILITY ==================================================+
The following is the procedure for making RC roles available and for
filling them.

First, the Culture Warden and the Wizard overseeing Reserved Characters
must agree on a list of what roles will be available in the culture. This
list may be changed as often as desired. As for Reserved Races, certain
cultures will have a quota of certain races available to them depending on
where these races make their homes (see NEWS RC THEME) and on how many
active members the culture has. As for Features, while the activity of the
culture is again taken into consideration, the primary concern is of which
characters are most needed for the overall plot of the culture at the given
time.

Once the openings are set, the CW may fill them as he or she deems
appropriate. Note that the openings need not be all filled at once, and
that if no player is found appropriate for the role that it is better to
leave it open. Once a selection has been made, the CW will inform the RC
Wizard, who will make the Feature name available and/or set the race of the
character in question and make other settings as needed.

(continued in NEWS RC LOSING)
+============================================================================+
& rc losing

& policy rc losing

+==== NEWS RC LOSING ========================================================+
There are many different reasons a player may lose a RC role, including:

1) The role was given for a specified length of time, such as a TP or MP or
till a book event. At the end of this period, the character is retired.

2) The character died. Features must die only when specified in the books,
at which point they are retired. When a Reserved Race character dies, a new
character of that race may be created if desired.

3) The player tired of the role.

4) The CW decided to revoke the role from the player due to non-compliance
of NEWS RC DUTIES, or at his or her own discretion, having ensured that
reasonable steps are taken to allow the player the opportunity to rectify
the situation.

In any case, the CW will inform the RC Wizard of his or her decision, and
the RC Wizard will lock the name and/or remove the race and other special
settings.

+==== NEWS RC IC/OOC ========================================================+
Not uncommonly, the role of the IC (Feature) Ruler of a culture will be
played by the culture's CW, as it streamlines the management of the
culture. Due to a myriad of possibilities, however, it is often someone
other than the CW--perhaps another CA--who will play the IC ruler. This may
be due to the not-inconsiderable weight of responsibility incumbent on the
CW, or it may simply come down to personal preference for a character. In
some instances, it is more practical for the CW to play more of a "field
leader" type rather than the lord on his throne.

In such a case the Culture Warden's decisions regarding theme are to be
carefully upheld by the IC Ruler. Feature characters, while expected to be
knowledgeable on theme, are still bound by the rulings of their Culture
Wardens.

+============================================================================+

+==== NEWS RC TEMPORARY =====================================================+
Should the need arise for a reserved role to be filled on an immediate and
very temporary basis--say, for just one session, or over the course of two
or three days--a CW may allow any player of his choosing to do so without
having to get the name officially unlocked. This is done by simply having
the player either @emit the character or rename his existing character,
putting a "." or other symbol at the end in the case of a Feature name. The
player should not create a new character for this purpose.

Temporary RCs will not receive special combat system stats or -training,
and should not use the coded combat system if the scene they are in
involves any combat.

Although only temporarily in the role, the players playing such characters
are expected to conduct themselves as any permanent RC in terms of IC
behavior and OOC conduct.

Beleriand supports a number of cultures and species, more then most games
on the net in fact. Everyone holds an important place in the world of
Middle- Earth and is represented in the game as such. You as a player can
join any of these cultures that allows the species you have chosen, most
places allow only one or two species so be careful in choosing species. You
may not get to go where you first thought... First and foremost on your
mind must always be the special traits of the species and your character,
there are some things that separate Sindar elves from Noldor elves, more
so, elves from Men and so on. Beyond the four normal player races (Elves,
Dwarves, Men and Orcs) there are the Restricted Races (RR) that are
available (by application, see NEWS Restricted Races) to those players who
can show and does show the greatest will to participate and take part in
what goes on in the game, role- playing skills and a solid knowledge about
the RR is also required. A RR character is special and often has abnormal
stats and abnormal ways of Role- playing, it is not something lightly taken
on. Many demands are placed on those.

The Elves are the Firstborn Children of Iluvatar (Q: The Father of All) and
He gave them being and life within the Halls of Ea, specifically in Arda,
the World. The Firstborn were created closer in semblance to the Valar,
which is to say their spirits and bodies are immortal and bound to the
Earth to thrive or decline as it does. This virtue can be either a blessing
or a curse, for though the Elves are immune to disease, poison and old age,
they can be killed by physical means or simply live so long; they become
exhausted by the burden of life. But, in dying at last, they are not
permitted to leave Arda, as the Edain may, but instead, are eventually
reincarnated to live again. So, true rest and peace after a hard existence
isn't their Fate, according to the will of Iluvatar.

By the shores of Cuivienen (Q: Waters of Awakening), the Elves first woke
from the sleep Iluvatar placed on them. At this time, there was no Sun or
Moon, but only the Stars created by Varda, the Vala of Light. Therefore,
the first thing the newly wakened Elves saw were the stars shining above in
the darkened sky. For this reason, among others, they are called the Eldar,
or People of the Stars and they revere Varda above all other Valar. But, as
the first of living things with a speaking voice, they called themselves,
Quendi, or, the Speakers. This is the general name for Elves on Beleriand,
the Species name, which can be further divided as will be explained.

The name 'Eldar', though first given to the whole Species of Elves, later
came to mean only those who followed the Vala Orome as he led the new
people on the Great Journey into the West. The History of the Valar and
their first meeting with the Elves is noted in other NEWS files. For now,
we will concentrate on the Sundering of the Elves, the reason there are
Sub-species and the differences between them. As noted, the first division
of the Elves occurred when the majority followed Orome into the West and
they retained the name Eldar. It is from this group that the characters for
role-play on Beleriand are available. The remaining group were called
'Avari', meaning, 'the Unwilling' and they, so far, are not available for
role-play. The Eldar, to add to the confusion, are further divided into the
Sub-species: Noldor, Vanyar and Teleri. Let's take a look at them.

The Eldar are sub-divided as follows:

NOLDOR: The followers of Finwe. Also called the Deep Elves and the High
Elves. Their love for gems and beautiful things crafted by their own skill
eventually led them on the road to pride and arrogance. They are most hated
by Morgoth, the Dark Enemy of the World.

VANYAR: The followers of Ingwe. Also called the Fair Elves. They are most
loved by Manwe Sulimo. This is the smallest tribe, all of them having gone
to Aman. None of the Vanyar are in Middle-Earth, so, are not available for
role- play in Beleriand.

TELERI: the followers of Elwe and Olwe. Also called the Sea Elves and the
Singers. They were the largest tribe of Elves and are even further divided.

UMANYAR
As noted above, the Calaquendi, or 'Elves of the Light', were the Vanyar,
Noldor and those Teleri who actually journeyed to Aman. These Quendi lived
in the Light of the Two Trees and prospered from this radiance. The
Moriquendi, or 'Elves of the Darkness', never dwelt in Aman, receiving none
of this beneficence. This group of Quendi included the Nandor, and the
Laiquendi; and, they, along with the Sindar, also were called, Umanyar, or
'Not of Aman'.

(continued in NEWS ELVES DESCRIPTION)
+============================================================================+
& elves description
+==== NEWS ELVES DESCRIPTION ================================================+
The Quendi are similar to the Edain in appearance, though they are usually
taller and less bulky than the Secondborn. Since their bodies and spirits
were made closer in nature to the Valar, they are usually more hardy and
stronger, as well, though on an individual basis, these qualities might
vary. Even among the Quendi, there are differences. Elves who went to Aman
and lived under the influence of the Two Trees, the Light that was before
Sun or Moon, are even taller than those Elves who never came to Valinor.
Generally, elves have the normal range of hair and eye color, though these
hues would be richer and more vibrant than these same traits among Men or
Dwarves. Elvish ears vary in form, but generally are more 'leaf-shaped'
than Mannish ears. Their eyes are more 'almond' shaped, though not
completely, and tend to be of the normal colors, as well. Remember,
however, that those Elves who lived in Aman could have more unique eye
color, due to the influence of the Light of the Trees. Perhaps brighter
colors than those who did not see this Light.

+==== NEWS ELVES DESCRIPTION 2 ==============================================+
A more specific description for each Sub-specie of Elves can be found under
the topics: Noldor, Sindar and Laiquendi. Keep in mind when you are
considering your description that in all cases, a description that is
within the boundaries of the theme of the Silmarillion is preferred. For
example, to describe a Laiquende, one should choose the normal ranges of
hair color, such as brown, to sandy brown, while avoiding 'green'. Though
Laiquende are a type of 'Wood Elf', they never had green hair.

(continued in NEWS ELVES NOLDOR)
+============================================================================+
& elves noldor
+==== NEWS ELVES NOLDOR =====================================================+
The Noldor are called the Deep Elves or Gnomes and they love all things
made by hand with skill. They prefer to live in halls of stone that have
been designed according to their own desires, and to dwell in highlands or
hills. They were friends and students of the Vala, Aule, and they learned
much from him concerning crafting and lore. They take delight in languages
and scripts, embroidery, drawing and sculpting. The Noldor were the first
to discover how to create gems and are master smiths unsurpassed save by
their teacher, Aule. In appearance, the Noldor are tall, have intense,
shining eyes and usually have dark or even raven hair. _The Silmarillion_
index states of Finarfin, "Alone among the Noldorin princes he and his
descendants had golden hair, derived from his mother Indis, who was a
Vanyarin Elf." (Of course Fingolfin was also Indis' son - apparently,
however, golden hair, at least among Noldorin 'princes' was peculiar to
only Vanyar Elves and some of their descendants.). They tend to dress in a
courtly manner, or at least in an elegant, noble style and are fond of
wearing jewelry and gemstones of many kinds.

(continued in NEWS ELVES SINDAR)
+============================================================================+
& elves sindar
+==== NEWS ELVES SINDAR =====================================================+
The Sindar are called the Grey Elves or the Elves of the Twilight, since
they never came to Aman, yet, they have seen the Light of the Trees in the
persons of Thingol, their King, and Melian the Maia, their Queen. They are
remnants of the Teleri who lingered on the shores of Beleriand and are
further divided as those who dwell still on the shores at Falas, and those
who live in Doriath. They prefer to live in forests or along the coasts in
structures made from the surrounding region, some of which may actually be
up in the trees. They were most loved by Osse, a Maia of the oceans and
they learned shipbuilding and watercrafting and singing from him. Of all
the Eldar, they have the fairest voices. Under the tutelage of Melian and
Thingol, they soon surpassed all the Elves that yet remained in
Middle-Earth in skill and wisdom, until the return of the Noldor. The
Sindar are tall and have a wide range of hair and eye color. They tend to
dress in a practical manner and are not overly concerned with possessions
or appearances.

(continued in NEWS ELVES LAIQUENDI)
+============================================================================+
& elves laiquendi
+==== NEWS ELVES LAIQUENDI ==================================================+
The Laiquendi are called the Green Elves of Ossiriand and are a remnant of
the Nandor, who were themselves, a sundered tribe of Teleri who turned
aside from the Great Journey into the west. They chose to go no farther and
populated the Vales of the Anduin in the East. After many long years, a
part of these people chose to continue the journey and they came west into
Beleriand and settled the Land of Seven Rivers. They were welcomed as kin
by Thingol and they acknowledged his rule over Beleriand. In appearance,
they are similar to the Sindar, but less tall and less 'wise'. They are
indeed, Moriquendi, meaning they have never seen the Light of the Trees.
Their homes are usually in the trees and hidden. Of all the Eldar, they
seem to be closest in harmony with the natural world, and their attire and
possessions have a more 'rustic' appearance as a result.

The Laiquendi are renowned archers and hunters, their skills easily
surpassing even the more aggressive Noldor in this regard.
+============================================================================+
& dwarves
+==== NEWS DWARVES ==========================================================+
Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves were not the direct creation of Iluvatar.
Aule, the Vala Smith (see NEWS POWERS), in his impatience for the coming of
the Children of Iluvatar, and yearning for beings other than himself that
he could love and teach, made the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves secretly,
under the mountains of Middle-earth. Iluvatar forgave Aule for his
presumptuous imitation, seeing his sincerity and true desire, and He gave
the Dwarves spirits of their own and blessed them. Thus they became the
Third Children of Iluvatar, the children of His adoption. Iluvatar
prophesied, however, that there would, in time, be strife between the
Children of his Choice and the Children of his Adoption. Aule set the Seven
Fathers to rest underneath the mountains of Middle-earth, in far-sundered
places, so they might not awaken before the Elves.

Aule was well aware of the threat Melkor posed to his creation. He made
them, therefore, extremely strong, short (four and a half to five feet
tall) and stocky, resistant to fire, and hardier than any other race.
Unswerving and proud, Dwarves can not be dominated by another will, and
never forget a wrong or a debt. As the children of Aule, Dwarves are
naturally attracted to substances, to the depths of the earth, and to
crafts; they are great miners and craftsmen and work wonders with stone,
metal, and jewels. Their greatest flaws are a tendency toward wrath,
possessiveness, and gold-lust.

(continued in NEWS DWARVES 2)
+============================================================================+
& dwarves 2
& dwarves2
+==== NEWS DWARVES 2 ========================================================+
Dwarves live about 250 years and marry about the age of 100. Few women are
born among them, and these look to non-Dwarves just like male Dwarves. All
Dwarves wear beards. Dwarven society is male dominated, and their women are
generally not allowed to go to war (however, see NEWS GENDER POLICY).
Although like mortal Men the Dwarves do die of old age, like the immortal
Elves they do not leave this sphere, and are gathered into the Halls of
Mandos. The Elves, however, claim that the Dwarves have no life beyond Arda
and the death of their bodies.

In battle the Dwarven hero has a definite advantage. Tolkien says that
Dwarves are "the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs," and "the most
redoubtable warriors of all the Speaking Peoples" (Elves, Men). Their
disadvantage chiefly lies when facing foes greater than Elves or Men: Ents,
Dragons, Balrogs, and such. Against such foes Men and Elves are generally
more successful.

The Dwarves call themselves Khazad. The Sindarin equivalent is Hadhod,
though by far their most common name in Beleriand is Naugrim (Naug
singular), or related forms. Another Elvish form is Gonnhirrim, meaning
Masters of Stone. The language of the Dwarves is Khuzdul, Dwarvish, which
was taught to the Fathers by Aule himself, whom the Dwarves name Mahal.

The Dwarven Fathers awoke not long after the Elves. Dwalin, Father of the
Broadbeams, and Thrar, Father of the Firebeards, awoke beneath Mount Dolmed
in the Blue Mountains (the Ered-Luin), which serves as the eastern border
of the land called Beleriand. To the north of Dolmed the Broadbeams founded
Belegost, or Gabilgathol in their tongue, the Mickleburg, the Mighty
Fortress. To the south, the Firebeards built Nogrod (Novrod), Tumunzahar in
their tongue, the Hollowbold or Hollow Delving.

The remaining Fathers awoke far to the east and south of Beleriand, and
come little into the tales of these days. Durin, the Eldest, and Father of
the Longbeards, awoke alone at Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty
Mountains (the Hithaeglir, east from Beleriand). Gundabad still serves as
the worldwide capital for the Dwarves, who all remain in communication with
each other, but by our time the chief mansion of the Longbeards is south of
Gundabad beneath Zirak-Zigil, and the city is called Hadhodrond, or
Khazad-dum, the Dwarf- mansion.

Both the folks of Belegost and Nogrod have pretty good relations with the
Noldor, as they share with them the reverence for Aule, teacher of the
Noldor. In particular, the Dwarves of Belegost are staunch friends of all
the Elves, especially with Thingol of Doriath, for whom they built
Menegroth his stronghold (for pay). The Broadbeams are also of great help
to the Elves in battle against Angband, great allies of Maedhros and
trustworthy. Azaghal is their mighty king.

The Dwarves of Nogrod, however, are less friendly with the Elves than are
the Dwarves of Belegost. The Firebeards have among them the greatest smiths
in Middle-earth, including the great Telchar. And while they aided the
Elves in many great works, including the building of Nargothrond, and often
have dealings with them, it is only when they themselves can get profit out
of the dealing. In them may more clearly be seen the prophecy of Iluvatar
concerning this race, though at our time period there have been no serious
quarrels with the Elves.

The Dwarves of the two great mansions of the Blue Mountains are called the
Great Dwarves, as a comparison to the other sub-race of Dwarves in
Beleriand: the Petty-dwarves. Their tale is a sorrowful one. Exiled from
Nogrod or Belegost in the far past, perhaps for some dark crimes none can
remember, they were the first to wander Beleriand. Their dissimilarity with
the Great Dwarves became greater over the years, for they became smaller,
and hunched, and wild-haired little creatures. So it is that, when the
Elves came into Beleriand, they hunted these unknown beasts, for long not
recognizing their relation to the Great Dwarves of the Mountains. But then
they left the "Nibin-noeg" alone.

The Moors of the Petty-dwarves, between the vales of Narog and Sirion, was
the area they particularly settled. There, in the crown of the hill
Sharbhund (later called Amon Rudh by the Elves), they delved
Bar-en-Nibin-noeg. Yet their chief mansions were at Nulukkhizdin, the
Caverns of Narog. But the Elves, wishing to inhabit that place, drove them
away, and built Nargothrond there. At our time there are not more than a
few dozen Petty-Dwarves left, taking refuge at Sharbhund. Now, while less
great than the Great Dwarves, the Petty-dwarves are still very proud and
possess their own dignity. They too have had their Dwarf-lords. They hate
Elves and Orcs alike, and feel very little kinship with other Dwarves.

Men are referred to in relation to Elves as the "Second-born", for they
arose much later in the history of Arda.

Little is known of the course of events the mannish folk experienced in
their journey from far to the East of Beleriand, where they awoke as the
Sunlight of Arien first dawned on Middle-Earth. In the East they had been
befriended by Avari and Nandor Elves, from whom they learned some speech
and music. The Edain had also dealt, not always in a friendly manner, with
Dwarves in the East. But it was not until Men first crossed the Ered Luin
mountain range where they would later be met and befriended by Finrod
Felagund, that their lives became wound in with the events of Beleriand,
where they would settle in various lands.

After arriving in Beleriand from the East, their fortunes would be closely
bound with the fate and deeds of the First Age.

+==== NEWS MEN INTRODUCTION 2 ===============================================+
The Men known as Edain (or singularly Adan), who are in some places also
known as 'Fathers of Men' or 'Elf-friends' were the first to enter
Beleriand. They entered in three groups: First came the Beorians, who would
later settle in Dorthonion, then the Haladin (who brought with them the
Druedain), who after nearly being wiped out by Orcs would follow their
leader Lady Haleth to settle in the Forest of Brethil. The Marachians
entered Beleriand last. They were the most numerous, and would eventually
settle in Dor-lomin. Many years later, another distinct group, the
Easterlings, would find their way into Beleriand, and at first dwell
amongst the folk of Feanor's sons.

+============================================================================+
& men beor
+==== NEWS MEN BEOR =========================================================+
The first of the three groups of Men who comprise the Edain to enter
Beleriand were those who followed their chieftain Balan, who later took the
name of 'Beor' (Quenya: 'Vassal') because of his devoted service to Finrod
Felagund. It was Finrod who first befriended these people, and settled them
first in the region named Estolad (Q: 'encampment'), and then in later
years Dorthonion (Q: 'Land of Pines'), where other Noldorin Elves of the
House of Finarfin dwelt.

Of their appearance and demeanor, JRR Tolkien writes: "The People of the
House of Beor were dark or brown of hair; there eyes were grey and keen and
their faces fair and shapely. Lithe and lean in body, they were
long-enduring in hardship. Of all Men they were the most like the Noldor
and most loved by them; for they were eager of mind, cunning-handed, swift
in understanding, long in memory..."

(continued in NEWS MEN HALETH)
+============================================================================+
& men haleth
+==== NEWS MEN HALETH =======================================================+
Second of the Houses of the Edain to enter Beleriand were the Haladin. Like
the Beor who had entered before them, these people also were a loose-knit
group of clans who apparently had few or no real leaders. Because the
Green- Elves of Ossiriand were unfriendly, the Haladin passed north into
Thargelion, the country of Caranthir son of Feanor, where for some fifty or
sixty years they had peace. But Morgoth, seeing that he could not with lies
and deceit wholly estrange the Elves and Men, was filled with wrath and was
determined to do Men what hurt he could. He sent an Orc force to assail
their settlement, and the Haladin rallied together under the leadership of
the brave and fearless Haldad. He had twin children: Haleth, his daughter,
and Haldar, his son; and both were valiant in the defense. But Haldad would
be slain in a sortie against the Orcs; and Haldar too as he came to his
fathers defense.

It was left to Lady Haleth to gather the remnants of the Haladin, and make
Westwards. Briefly they dwelt in Estolad, yet yearning to go forth again,
did at last make it through hardship and loss to the Forest of Brethil.
That land was on the western edge of the Kingdom of Doriath, ruled by
Thingol, who grudgingly bequeathed the land to the People of Haleth by the
grace of Finrod Felagund.

(continued in NEWS MEN HALETH 2)
+============================================================================+
& men haleth 2
& men haleth2
+==== NEWS MEN HALETH 2 =====================================================+
As a people, the Haladin were somewhat shorter and broader than the Beor.
Yet many of them, including the line of Haldad and the Wardens of Brethil,
were as tall and strong as any of the Edain. In times of need, even their
women, of great heart and strength, would take arms and fight alongside the
Men. Their excellence at forest warfare strikes fear into the Orcs, who
dare come hither at great risk, and so the Kingdom of Nargothrond, where
Finrod Felagund reigns, is further protected.

(continued in NEWS MEN MARACH)
+============================================================================+
& men marach
+==== NEWS MEN MARACH =======================================================+
The Marachians were the last of the Houses of Edain to enter Beleriand.
They were the most numerous and best organized, following their chieftain
Marach. They too would settle first in Estolad where some folk of the Beor
and Haladin were. Eventually they would make their way to Hithlum, amidst
the folk of Fingolfin. It was there that Hador Lorindol, great-grandson of
Marach, entered into the household of Fingolfin, who loved him so that he
gave to Hador the lordship of Dor-lomin, and into that land Hador gathered
his folk and became the mightiest chieftain of the Edain.

Of their appearance and demeanor, JRR Tolkien writes: "Many of [Hador's]
people were like to him, golden-haired and blue-eyed; they were tall and
strong, quick to wrath and laughter, fierce in battle, generous to friend
and to foe, swift in resolve, fast in loyalty, joyous in heart, the
children of Illuvatar in the youth of Mankind."

(continued in NEWS MEN EASTERLINGS)
+============================================================================+
& men easterlings
+==== NEWS MEN EASTERLINGS ==================================================+
These peoples were diverse in many ways from the Edain who entered
Beleriand some hundred and more years before them. Tolkien describes them
as "short and broad, long and strong in the arm, and grew much hair on the
face and breast; their locks were dark as were their eyes, and their skins
were sallow or swart. But they were not all of one kind, in looks or in
temper, or in tongue. Some were not uncomely and were fair to deal with;
some were grim and ill- favoured and of little trust."

It was the folk of Bor who were of those most  honourable and trustworthy,
and they dwelt in Himring and other areas under the rule of the sons of
Feanor. The tribes of Ulfang and Lorgan, however, would prove treacherous
and serve Morgoth, though even he would betray them. In later years these
people would be forcibly settled in Dor-lomin, after the fall of Hador.

(continued in NEWS MEN DRUADAN)
+============================================================================+
& men druadan
+==== NEWS MEN DRUADAN =====================================================+
These were a people of a wholly different kind than any of the Edain. They
traveled into Beleriand along with the Haladin, and in the Forest of
Brethil they lived, though they never intermarried with the Edain.

JRR Tolkien writes of them, "To the eyes of Elves and other Men they were
unlovely in looks: they were stumpy (some four foot high) but very broad,
with heavy buttocks and short thick legs; their wide faces had deep-set
eyes with heavy brows, and flat noses... Their features were usually
impassive, the most mobile being their wide mouths; and the movement of
their wary eyes could not be observed save from close at hand."

They were excellent trackers with keen senses, and learned in herb-lore and
of all living things almost to the extent of the Elves, though untaught by
them. Even more mysterious were their abilities to seemingly perform feats
that easily could be perceived as 'magic'.

wiped out, though there are small remnants living in Dor-lomin and in

The Haladin, or the Folk of Haleth as they are often currently known, dwell
in the Forest of Brethil which they defend steadfastly. The North-South
road, which passes along their western border, remains controlled by them
and for the most part denied to the forces of Morgoth. Their leader is
Halmir, whose position is known as Warden of Brethil.

The Marachians, or the House of Hador as they are currently known, flourish
in the land of Dor-lomin, in close friendship to the Elves of Mithrim. For
now their land is less in peril and they have sent a large contingent in
assistance of the defense of the central portions of Beleriand.

Easterlings, very few in number, dwell in the lands of Himring and Amon

 CURRENTLY      How they fare in our game

Type NEWS ORCS <topic> for more information.
+============================================================================+
& orcs introduction
+==== NEWS ORCS INTRODUCTION ================================================+
Orcs represent the most numerous of Morgoth's minions and perhaps the
gravest transgression of the mightiest Vala to Eru, for they were bred
(from various potential sources) in mockery of the Elves, The Firstborn.

In all of JRR Tolkien's works, Orcs represent the basest, dreadful and most
offensive and repugnant of (Earthly) mankind. Rather than just being some
soul-less essence of 'pure evil' without any vestige of sentient thought,
they are often thoughtful and sometimes even humourous. Certainly they are
'bad', and their free will is subjugated to Melkor's dominance under fear
of his torment.

Within those bounds, Orcs as players in our game can be very compelling
characters. In-culture Role-play is as much important for an Orc-player as
any other player.

(continued in NEWS ORCS ORIGIN)
+============================================================================+
& orcs origin
+==== NEWS ORCS ORIGIN ======================================================+
Orcs were first bred by Melkor (Morgoth) many thousands of years ago in
mockery of the Elves of Iluvatar. It is well known that Melkor, though
mighty, did not himself create. Rather he corrupted and twisted what Eru
and the Vala made.

Long before there were Elves, Orcs, Men or Dwarves, Melkor had corrupted
many of the Maia to his service. Best known of these is Sauron and the
seven Balrogs. It would seem plausible that Thuringwethil the Vampire and
Glaurung Father of Dragons were themselves lesser Maia. So it is likely
that once Elves awoke and some were snared by Melkor and his minions, that
some combination of lesser Maia and Elves were the stock of the first Orcs.
Later Men potentially were too. Now JRR Tolkien himself expressed at
different times and places variations on this theme of Orcish origin. About
all that is widely accepted is that Melkor could not have created the Orcs
and that Dwarves, being by nature resistant to corruption or evil
exploitation, were not part of Melkor's breeding of the most numerous of
his evil minions.

(continued in NEWS ORCS APPEARANCE)
+============================================================================+
& orcs appearance
+==== NEWS ORCS APPEARANCE ==================================================+
Here again, JRR Tolkien was somewhat vague on Orcish appearance. As Orcs
exist in mockery of Elves, it's logical their appearance would mock beauty
with hideousness. There are many physical variations as JRR Tolkien
describes them. Some common traits: Broad, relatively short-statured
bodies. Long arms, large hands, thick legs. Dark skin, swart faces,
slant-eyed, fangs. Of course all of these traits need not be exhibited in
all Orcs.

In the First Age, Orcs should be strong and imposing in battle. They are
still under the might of Morgoth. Following Morgoth's defeat at the end of
the First Age, Orcs are dispersed and not until the Early Third Age, when
Sauron again masses them and breeds the Uruk-Hai are they again as potent.
So it's valid conjecture the Orcs of Beleriand are at least as tough as
Uruk-Hai. And that's tough!

(continued in NEWS ORCS CURRENTLY)
+============================================================================+
& orcs currently
+==== NEWS ORCS CURRENTLY ===================================================+
Currently (our game's setting), the Orcs are part of the Angband culture
Beleriand's largest. Now that the Siege of Angband was broken, they range
wide over Beleriand from their northern fortress, many bolstering the
already horrific forces of Werewolves.

As providers of much of the needed conflict of our story, in our game
players with Orc characters are in a high profile position where they may
make a difference while playing compelling and fun characters. Orc players
are provided as much opportunity for in-culture RP as with other species.
Opportunities for advancement include Werewolves, Balrogs, and Dragons.

+============================================================================+
& werewolves
+==== NEWS WEREWOLVES =======================================================+
The Werewolves (Gaurhoth) were introduced into our game as an evil RR that
would bridge the gap between the Orcs and the Balrogs. That is clearly
thematic as Sauron was a sorcerer closely aligned with werewolves. He in
fact, can take the shape of a werewolf himself and does so at his
discretion. Thus it stands to reason that Sauron would favor these servants
in relation to those others previously stated. Sauron created the
werewolves of Wizard's Isle of which there is a large number, but that
number is not set in the texts. Werewolves are nearly as intelligent if not
as intelligent as Men and can speak in languages understood by both Men and
Elves. They are also able to mystically hide in darkness. It is uncertain
exactly how this is done. However, it seems most logical to explain it as
either being exceptionally stealthy or being able to magically manipulate
darkness about themselves but *NOT* to any great degree. They also seem to
be able to create an aura of fear about themselves. Much like one would
naturally expect from a pack of normal wolves for example. In RP, the
characters opposite the werewolf character may choose to react however they
wish to this as it is not an overly powerful ability. The werewolf's poses
should reflect that there is something slightly mystical in the way it bays
that might cause a degree of trepidation.

+==== NEWS WEREWOLVES 2 =====================================================+
Werewolves have an unclean bite that can cause a bad infection/poisoning.
This 'poisoning' can even affect Elves, though the degree that it can do so
is uncertain (simple illness, incapacitation or death) and should be left
up to the Elf character being mauled. Though it is clear that it can cause
death in Men. Werewolves may be described as being pretty much any color
that the player wishes. They may also be described as having glowing eyes
(though the color of that glow is uncertain in the texts). They may also be
described as being large (the largest being 58 in. in height at the
shoulder). However, in all other aspects, they should be described as
appearing as a normal wolf.

& great eagles
& eagles
+==== NEWS GREAT EAGLES =====================================================+
The Eagles (Thoron) of Beleriand play a very decisive and prominent role in
Professor Tolkien's literary works. Indeed, this race is mentioned numerous
times and plays a major role in the overall epic. It is for that reason
that player characters belonging to this RR are clearly within the bounds
of theme on this MUSH. It is also important to point out that the Eagles of
Beleriand are counted among the most ancient of races and are notably
renown as the messengers of Manwe, thus obviously a noble and goodly race.
The eryies of the Eagles as stated in the texts, are located in the peaks
Crissaegrim about the Tumladen Vale. Eagles are similar in all regards to a
regular eagle except on a much larger scale. Eagles enjoy the ability of
swift flight and keen eyesight as well as a renown battle prowess. Also,
their reputation seems to proceed them. Thus causing a degree of natural
fright in their enemies. Though there is nothing in any of the texts that
could be found to lead one to believe that they have any mystical abilities
aside from their high intelligence, wisdom and ability to speak.

& balrogs
+==== NEWS BALROGS ==========================================================+
The Balrogs may well be described as the 'fists of Morgoth'. They have
played a major part in every one of the five battles of Beleriand, and also
have hand their hand in the deaths of many an Elf: Feanor, Fingon,
Ecthelion and Glorfindel the most renowned among these. Second among the
throngs of Melko in strength/prowess only to the Dragons they are certainly
a force to be reckoned with, and are thus included among the RRs of the
MUSH. Balrogs were formerly Maia corrupted by Melkor. Given the position of
Captains of Angband they are a pompous group who control by fear.
Formidable opponents they have slain many a renowned elf. Cloaked in
shadows they control their fiery nature.

This section shall pertain to those possible RRs that may be found
throughout the texts but for one reason or another, shall not be played at
this time on this MUSH. The reasons may include such things as a lack of
pertinent information to be found in the texts in order to adequately
construct the RR in question or a degree of ignorance on the part of the RR
Character that would render it relatively unplayable in the context of this
game.

Trolls shall not be played on this MUSH at this time due to the lack of
inherent intelligence in the character. The player would be able to pose
nothing more then mindless bashing. Therefore it is strongly suggested that
the CAs of Angband be allowed to set scenes that make mention of the fact
that trolls are taking part in battles, etc. But that the trolls themselves
are not actually being played, but rather are being emitted.

Ghosts and other such 'undead', though sparsely mentioned here and there

this MUSH at this time. The reason being that though there is some *small*
amount of text to support the notion that they are present in this
timeline, the information is so scarce as to make it exceedingly difficult
to fashion an RR for them. If such an occasion may come to pass whereby an
undead is called for to take part in a scene, those considering such a
thing should consult with an appropriate CA (or body of CA's) for further
information and/or permission to do so. The spirit in question would then
likely best be emitted for effect.

* The History of Middle-earth Index (Index)

The above are resources by third-party authors who compiled their
information from research of Tolkien's works. All of the above are fairly
reliable, and certainly handy reference material here on this game. They
are not considered quotable resources on this game, but rather tools for
researching Tolkien.
+============================================================================+
& canon
& theme canon
+==== NEWS CANON ============================================================+
The question of canon is a tricky one, so here we have tried to break it
down as completely and concisely as possible, to provide a clear method of
settling discrepancies between resources.

1) "Thematic" refers to the setting of this game. Theme is defined by the
   game admins based on the books as is deemed suitable. Canon is a major
   consideration in Theme, but not the only one. See NEWS SOURCES.

2) All Middle-earth writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.R. Tolkien are
   "Canonical". See NEWS BOOKS for a good list. That is to say, if and only
   if it bears the Tolkien name as author is a work to be considered an
   official resource of Beleriand. However, between these works there will
   often be discrepancies, and one version must be chosen over another to
   be the Thematic version. Therefore:

(continued in NEWS CANON 2)
+============================================================================+
& canon 2
& canon2
& theme canon 2
& theme canon2
+==== NEWS CANON 2 ==========================================================+
3) The 1977 Silmarillion is the "Standard". It is a reasonably consistent
   version of the mythology. If anything from a source contradicts
   something in The Silmarillion, it shall not be considered Thematic.
   Note that only the contradiction is considered invalid, not the entire
   resource. If a character or incident or other "fact" appears in a
   Canonical resource but not in The Silmarillion, and The Silmarillion
   in no way refutes it, it may be considered Thematic.

4) Beleriand has a "Flavor", and that flavor is generally defined by The
   Silmarillion. This is somewhat harder to nail down and can be open to
   interpretation, but should not be disregarded. The early mythology of
   The Book of Lost Tales differs in mood, emphasis, and character from
   the much later Silmarillion, and while some material therein is useful,
   it must be taken carefully and consciously applied to the world of The
   Silmarillion. The Hobbit is a lighthearted children's tale that was
   conceived as something of an alternate world from The Silmarillion.
   Hence there are elements therein which have no place in our world, as
   Hobbits, Trolls, and Skin-changing Bear-men; while common elements like
   Dwarves and Elves are subtly different. Also consider the dialogue used

+============================================================================+
& canon 3
& canon3
& theme canon 3
& theme canon3
+==== NEWS CANON 3 ==========================================================+
   in The Silmarillion, which is a more archaic style than that of LR.
   These are examples of things to keep in mind. All Canonical resources
   are taken into account, but ultimately it must fit in with The
   Silmarillion in order to fly.

5) "Third-party" material is never considered a true resource. Some sources
   are published by authors other than the Tolkiens, some claiming to be
   simply Tolkien research (as David Day), others blatantly creating their
   own material based on Tolkien (as ICE's Middle-earth Roleplaying). In
   either case, this material is to be regarded carefully and skeptically.
   Material from these sources may be used IF it fits in with all Tolkien
   says and fits in with the game, but is no more considered official than
   anything original created by a player on the game (which, after all,
   becomes a real part of the game's theme as soon as it enters into RP,
   unless it is later judged to be unthematic because of conflicts with
   Canon).

our theme, but that file more specifically addresses disputes between
resources.

The purpose of this file, then, is to discuss the *usefulness* of the
respective resources for the Beleriand setting. THE SILMARILLION,
naturally, is the single most useful resource as it provides a reasonably
consistent overview of the tales of Beleriand. But it provides only a
summary, as it were, that Tolkien wrote as a backdrop for the Great Tales.
How, then, is one to access these Tales? The answer lies in The History of
Middle-earth series. Only by reading the complete series can one fully
appreciate the full scope and awesome majesty of Tolkien's mythology. It is
certainly recommended that you do so, but if not, at least we can point out
the highlights that are most relevant to the MUSH.

UNFINISHED TALES contains the longest of the Great Tales, the tragic saga
named Narn i Hin Hurin, or the Tale of the Children of Hurin. A prose
narrative of great importance and yet easy to read, it is also the most
complete Tale. Turin's adventures span most of Western Beleriand, and thus
is a good introduction to most of the lands. This book also contains an
account of Tuor's earlier adventures and several other relevant writings.

THE LAYS OF BELERIAND contains The Lay of Leithian, the famous poetic
rendition of the Great Tale of Tinuviel. This is a high tale of Beren and
Luthien and their quest to retrieve a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth
himself. A very important and enjoyable read. This book also contains a
poetic version of the Children of Hurin which fills in some of the gaps in
the Narn.

THE WAR OF THE JEWELS provides a lot of clarification and details to The
Silmarillion, including dates for all the events. There is an interesting
section on languages along with a legend of the Awakening of the Quendi,
but the highlight is The Wanderings of Hurin, a continuation of the Narn
which tells of Hurin's adventures after being released from Angband. A
really good story with a lot of great info for Brethil, told in full
narrative form.

THE BOOK OF LOST TALES Part Two contains Tolkien's first version of the
mythology, and while it is early and does not quite match the flavour of
The Silmarillion, it does include full versions of all the Great Tales,
including some that Tolkien never rewrote and thus had them in his mind
still as THE version of that Tale. Such a one is The Fall of Gondolin,
Tolkien's earliest and favorite work, which supplies most of the Gondolin
theme for this MUSH. Similarly, The Tale of the Necklace of the Dwarves
found herein is an important resource for Nogrod.

A few other resources are important for good general information about
Middle-earth. MORGOTH'S RING profoundly explores the theology of
Middle-earth, from the nature of evil to the fate of Men, and also includes
a very useful essay called Laws and Customs of the Eldar. THE PEOPLES OF
MIDDLE-EARTH includes many short writings of many different topics of great
interest. THE LORD OF THE RINGS, particularly the Appendices, contains a
lot of essential information which is never repeated elsewhere. Finally,
THE LETTERS OF J.R.R. TOLKIEN provides a window into the author's mind and
is an indispensable tool for interpreting his works.

+==== NEWS SOURCES ==========================================================+
In order to understand the relationship between Beleriand MUSH and
Tolkien's novels, let us imagine that a real Beleriand existed in history,
or that a real Beleriand exists in another world, it matters not which.
Real Beleriand is exactly how Beleriand is described in Tolkien's books--
at least, it is exactly how it is described in The Silmarillion and other
sources which agree with it (see NEWS CANON for a detailed discussion on
that matter). In Real Beleriand all the lands and characters are just the
same as in the books, and events progress exactly when and how it is
described in the books.

Now, we can not suppose that ONLY the events described in the books happen
in Real Beleriand, or that only the characters named in the books exist in
Real Beleriand. For it is a real world, and while we know a few tales of
Beleriand, there are many other tales to be told.

Beleriand MUSH is another world which is not the same as Real Beleriand but
it is close. In most cases it is as close as we can possibly make it to
Real Beleriand. In fact, we could say that up till the Year of the Sun 450
it was exactly the same as Real Beleriand.

But after that point new things started to happen. Stories began to be told
in our familiar landscape, Great Tales of new characters who rose suddenly
to scarce less importance than the great princes and heroes of whom Tolkien
wrote. Tolkien's tales still took place, though perhaps not at quite the
same time or in quite the same manner. But in any case, what happens in
Beleriand MUSH is real for the world of Beleriand MUSH, though it may or
may not be exactly so in Real Beleriand.

In summary: Beleriand MUSH runs on a divergent timeline from the books. The
setting is essentially the same as that of the books, but it may be decided
in certain cases to run things a little differently. In general, however,
the goal of the game is to play in Tolkien's world, and the utmost care
will be taken to make sure that our world mirrors that world as much as
possible, recreating scenes from the books and filling in the gaps wherever
we please.

+==== NEWS CULTURES =========================================================+
Each character in Beleriand MUSH must choose a homeland, a realm or culture
that he is from. This not only provides your character with a home base for
roleplay, but also helps shape your character's background and identity,
his place in the vast scheme of the factions of Beleriand. There are
currently four realms of the Elves, one Dwarven kingdom, and two nations
of Men. The vastest kingdom of all, though, is that of all evil creatures
serving Morgoth, whose stronghold is Angband to the north of Beleriand.

In the beginning Iluvatar made the Ainur, the Holy Ones, of his thought,
and they made a great Music before him. In this Music the World was begun,
for Iluvatar made visible the song of the Ainur. And many among them became
enamoured of its beauty; therefore Iluvatar gave to their vision Being.
Those who desired it arose and entered into the World at the beginning of
Time, and it is their task to achieve it, and by their labours to fulful
the vision. The Great among these spirits the Elves name the Valar, the
Powers of Arda, and Men have often called them gods.

+============================================================================+
& powers manwe
& theme powers manwe
+==== NEWS POWERS MANWE =====================================================+
Manwe and Melkor were brethren in the thought of Iluvatar. The mightiest of
the Valar was in his beginning Melkor; but Manwe is dearest to Iluvatar and
understands most clearly his purposes. He was appointed to be, in the
fullness of time, the first of all Kings: lord of the realm of Arda and
ruler of all that dwell therein. In Arda his delight is in the winds and
the clouds, and in all the regions of the air, from the heights to the
depths, from the utmost borders of the Veil of Arda to the breezes that
blow in the grass. All swift birds, strong of wing, he loves, and they come
and go at his bidding.

Manwe is lord of the Valar, ruling their councils, confirming their deeds,
and hallowing their artifacts. His throne is set in Ilmarin atop the great
mount Taniquetil, whence he looks out over all the world.

Manwe is compassionate and wise, but he does not understand evil, being
free of it. So he was deceived into unchaining Melkor, thus allowing the
tragedy and glory of the wars of Elves and Men against the Darkness.

Manwe's element is Air. He influences sky, wind, weather, sight, poetry,
wisdom, birds, and the Vanyar.

Names: Manwe (Q. "Blessed One"); Sulimo (Q. "Breather"); King of Arda, the
Elder King, Lord of the West.
+============================================================================+
& powers varda
& theme powers varda
+==== NEWS POWERS VARDA =====================================================+
Varda is the spouse of Manwe. Too great is her beauty to be declared in the
words of Men or of Elves; for the light of Iluvatar lives still in her
face. In light is her power and her joy. Out of the deeps of Ea she came to
the aid of Manwe; for Melkor she knew from before the making of the Music
and rejected him, and he hated her, and feared her more than all others
whom Eru made.

Of all the Great Ones who dwell in this world the Elves hold Varda most in
reverence and love. They call upon her name out of the shadows of Middle-
earth, and uplift it in song at the rising of the stars.

Varda made the stars, filled the Lamps of the Valar with light, collected
the dews of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned newer stars and
constellations in preparation for the awakening of the Elves, hallowed the
Silmarils, and established the courses of the Moon and Sun.

Varda's element is Light. She influences stars, light of Arda, hearing, and
insight.

Names: Varda (Q. "The Exalted"); Elbereth (S. "Star Queen;" Q. "Elentari");
Tintalle (Q. "Kindler"); Gilthoniel (S. "Star Kindler"); Lady of the Stars;
Fanuilos (S. "Ever-white"); Snow-white.

& powers melkor
& theme powers melkor
+==== NEWS POWERS MELKOR ====================================================+
Mightiest among the Ainur and he to whom had been given the greatest gifts
of power and knowledge was Melkor. In the powers and knowledge of all the
other Valar he has a part, but he turned them to evil purposes, and uses
his strength in violence and tyranny.

Once in the world, Melkor's eagerness turned to jealousy and he was
excluded from the numbers of the Valar. Desiring to dominate created things
and the wills of others, Melkor in his envy and malice claimed Arda as his
own and, foiled in this by Manwe, hindered its completion and corrupted
many of the Maiar into serving him. In these struggles, the First War,
Melkor was at last defeated by Tulkas, but Arda was Marred.

However, Melkor soon returned to Arda in the far North. Before the Valar
could be aware of him he destroyed the Two Lamps, forcing them to retreat
to Aman. He ruled uncontested in Middle-earth until the Valar, concerned
for the safety of the Elves, defeated him in the Battle of the Powers and
carried him back to Valinor in chains, where he served three years in the
prison of Mandos. He then feigned repentance and was let free in Valinor,
where he spread evil lies and dissention. With Ungoliant, he finally
destroyed the Two Trees, and stole the Silmarils, the holy jewels filled
with the light of the Trees; and escaped back to Angband, his stronghold
north of Beleriand in Middle-earth.

From Angband Melkor rules his minions, defending the Silmarils against the
Noldorin exiles. Dismayed by the light of the Moon and Sun and the
fierceness of the Noldor, Melkor was at first defeated, and for nearly four
hundred years he has been besieged in Angband. But he spends the time
strengthening his forces, preparing to break the siege and bring Beleriand
and all Middle-earth under his dominion.

Melkor's element is Fire. He influences cold, crafts, materiality, earth,
Men, an Orcs. His symbol is the Iron Crown in which he set the Silmarils;
his emblem is a field of sable, unblazoned.

Names: Melkor (Q. "He Who Arises in Might;" S. "Belegur"); Morgoth (S.
"Dark Enemy"); Bauglir (S. "Constrainer); Belegurth (S. "Great Death").
+============================================================================+
& powers ulmo
& theme powers ulmo
+==== NEWS POWERS ULMO ======================================================+
Ulmo is the Lord of Waters. He is alone. He dwells nowhere long, but moves
as he will in all the deep waters about the Earth or under the Earth. He is
next in might to Manwe, and before Valinor was made he was closest to him
in friendship; but thereafter he went seldom to the councils of the Valar,
unless great matters were in debate. For he kept all Arda in thought, and
he has no need of any resting-place. Moreover he does not love to walk upon
land, and will seldom clothe himself in a body after the manner of his
peers. If the Children of Iluvatar behold him they are filled with a great
dread; for the arising of the King of the Sea is terrible, as a mounting
wave that strides to the land, with dark helm foam-crested and raiment of
mail shimmering from silver down into shadows of green. The trumpets of
Manwe are loud, but Ulmo's voice is deep as the deeps of the ocean which he
only has seen.

Nonetheless Ulmo loves both Elves and Men, and never abandoned them, not
even now when they lie under the wrath of the Valar. Ulmo speaks to those
who dwell in Middle-earth with voices that are heard only as the music of
water. For all seas, lakes, rivers, fountains and springs are in his
government; so that the Elves say that the spirit of Ulmo runs in all the
veins of the world. Thus news comes to Ulmo, even in the deeps, of all the
needs and griefs of Arda, which otherwise would be hidden from Manwe.

Ulmo's element is Water. He influences sea, rain, springs, music, and the
Teleri.

Names: Ulmo (Q. "Pourer, Rainer"); Lord of Waters; King of the Sea.
+============================================================================+
& powers aule
& theme powers aule
+==== NEWS POWERS AULE ======================================================+
Aule has might little less than Ulmo. His lordship is over all the
substances of which Arda is made. In the beginning he wrought much in
fellowship with Manwe and Ulmo; and the fashioning of all lands was his
labour. He is a smith and a master of all crafts, and he delights in works
of skill, however small, as much as in the mighty building of old. His are
the gems that lie deep in the Earth and the gold that is fair in the hand,
no less than the walls of the mountains and the basins of the sea. The
Noldor of the Elves learned most of him, and he was ever their friend.
Melkor was jealous of him, for Aule was most like himself in thought and in
powers; and there was long strife between them, in which Melkor ever marred
or undid the works of Aule, and Aule grew weary in repairing the tumults
and disorders of Melkor. Both, also, desired to make things of their own
that should be new and unthough of by others, and delighted in the praise
of their skill. But Aule remained faithful to Eru and submitted all that he
did to his will; and he did not envy the works of others, but sought and
gave counsel.

It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made by Aule, for so
greatly did he desire the coming of the Elves and Men, to have learners to
whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was unwilling to await
the fulfilment of the designs of Iluvatar. But seeing his folly, Aule
offered his creation to his Father, and prepared to destroy the work of his
presumption. But Iluvatar had compassion on Aule, because of his humility;
and gave life to the Dwarves, the children of his adoption.

Aule's element is Earth. He influences the material earth, skill, lore,
crafts, creativity, insight, materiality, the Dwarves, and the Noldor.

Names: Aule; the Smith; the Maker (Kh. "Mahal"); the Friend of the Noldor.

"Greatest in strength and deeds of prowess is Tulkas, who is surnamed
Astaldo, the Valiant." He was the last of the Vala to come to Arda, lending
his great strength and hardihood to the Vala against the foe Melkor.

Often is Arda filled with his laughter, and he delights most in wrestling
and contests of strength. He runs faster than any living thing on foot, and
his anger when riled passes before him like a mighty wind, scattering cloud
and darkness. His spouse is Nessa, the sister of Orome who is also lithe
and fleet of foot.

"His hair and beard are golden, and his flesh ruddy; his weapons are his
hands. He has little heed for either the past or future, and is of no avail
as a counsellor, but is a hardy friend."

The Book of Lost Tales has this to say of where Tulkas lived:
"...[Tulkas] dwelt amidmost of Valmar...His was a house of mirth and
revelry; and it sprang high into the air with many storeys, and had a tower
of bronze and pillars of copper in a wide arcade. In its court men played
and rivalled one another in doughty feats, and there at times would that
fair maiden Nessa wife of Tulkas bear goblets of the goodliest wine and
cooling drinks among the players."

in the wild; but she can outrun them, swift as an arrow with the wind in
her hair. In dancing she delights, and she dances in Valimar on lawns of
never fading green."

background and history can be made in any way, except the fact it must not
cross or be greater then that of theme. It's not very good to try and make
your character more glorious than, say, Beren. Adhere to the theme of
Tolkien's Middle-earth and you should do fine, there's quite a lot of room
to maneuver, if you take the time to be creative. Generally, you should
follow the outlook of your species and culture...but exceptions have and
will always be around - let your CAs decide if it's playable or not. In
fact, a player is in him/herself an exception, above the cut of the
Non-Player Characters and thus, standing out. There's a huge NPC
(Non-Player Character) population out there, you are just a little bit more
visible then they, a special person already. Make yourself even more
special in acts, words and deeds, make your character come alive...alive in
the world of Tolkien.
