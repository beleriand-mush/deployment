Note: this is an admin level topic and involves some coding knowledge.
      If you are not an admin and this makes no sense to you, don't worry 
      about it.  If you are a local admin but don't work with coding in your 
      area, you also don't need to worry about it.

PLAYER ZONES:

Every player has a "zone" which is set automatically for them when they join
a culture; the "-culture" command takes care of this.  The zone is actually
a regular object in itself, commonly called a "Zone Master Object" or ZMO.
For details on what zones are and how they work, see "HELP ZONE OBJECTS".
We will assume here that you know what ZMO's are, and how to put attributes
and locks on objects.

Our cultural ZMO's have multiple purposes.  One use is a place to code
"local" commands which are only available to members of a particular
culture.  Coding at this level is performed at the discretion of the 
admins of the particular culture.

& admin zones 2
==============================================================================
...ADMIN ZONES, continued ...

An important usage of player zones on Beleriand is to provide some information
about a culture to the system, for use by the various "global" commands. Every
culture MUST have a cultural ZMO.  The following things need to be done to 
make an acceptable cultural ZMO:

*) The ZONE LOCK on the ZMO needs to be secure.  The zone lock would 
   normally include the CW of that culture, and perhaps a couple
   of other people trusted with building and coding culture-wide.  It is
   possible but not required that all the LA's for that culture will
   be on the lock. It is also possible to have no one at all on the
   lock (ask a wizard to help with this if necessary).

*) The attribute NEWBIE_TITLE *should* be set on the ZMO.  The value of
   this attribute will be put in a players &TITLE attribute when they
   are -culture'd.  If this attribute does not exist, the title will
   default to "Citizen".

==============================================================================
& admin zones 3
==============================================================================
...ADMIN ZONES, continued ...

*) The attribute NEWBIE_WELCOME should be set on the ZMO.  The text in
   this attribute will be displayed to a player when they are -culture'd.
   The message should give give the new player a few hints to get started,
   such as the name of a local help command.  It needs to be fairly short
   though for the benefit of players with small terminals, no scrollback
   etcetera.  Maximum length of 20 lines (78 chars per line).

*) The attribute NEWBIE_HOME should be set on the ZMO.  This value needs
   to be the dbref# of the room where you want new members of the culture
   @link'ed for their initial home location.  Players will be 
   automatically @link'ed to this room.  Typical locations would be a
   "barracks" or "guest room" or somesuch.

   IMPORTANT:  The NEWBIE_HOME room must *also* have its zone set to the 
   cultural ZMO.  This might be different than all the zones for all the
   rest of the rooms in the culture, but is done as a safety check to
   make sure that players don't get linked to a room which doesn't belong
   to their culture.

*) The attribute CULTURE_CHANNEL should be set on the ZMO.  This value
   is the name of a -com channel which the player will automatically
   be joined to when they are -culture'd.

&admin site
Currently the Beleriand MUSH runs on a i386 running FreeBSD and is located
near Washington, DC in the United States. Our Site Admin
is Argon, who runs mux.net, and to whom we all owe lots of thanks, for he 
provides the machine, memory and fast connection. :D

The database is approximately 3.5 Megabytes compressed and about 12 Megabytes
residing in memory. See @config and @version for more configuration data.

Game Time is Eastern Standard/Daylight, or the same as New York City.

&format
This section explains the format of NEWS topics...

Firstly, NEWS does not support ANSI formatting. Also to stay consistent with
TinyFugue and other MUSH clients which will wrap their screens if the 22nd 
line is written to, the pages need to be delimited, with appropriate text.

I can't give the precise format in a NEWS topic, but this is sorta how it looks:

<ampersand> TOPIC ONE
.
These 21 lines describe the topic...

& admin conduct 
Beleriand admins of all levels are expected to set the example for proper
conduct in our community. From the longest tenured Wizard to the newest of
newbie helper Culture Support admins we all share a duty to act in a
manner that is ethical, constructive, friendly and above all in a way that
serves the best interests of the Beleriand community. Players will look up
to you, seeing in you an example of proper behaviour in Beleriand, both IC
and OOC. It is essential to remember this, that others will follow the
path you mark. A good admin inspires confidence, trust, and a desire to
keep in mind the common good of the MUSH. 

 
Please type 'NEWS ADMIN CONDUCT 2' for more on this topic

&admin conduct 2 
It is worth taking a moment here to talk a little about interaction with
players. Admins must remember that they have a tremendous amount of
authority and control over the MUSH lives of the Beleriand players. When
dealing with a player in an official capacity it is vital that admins
demonstrate a professional demeanor that should include patience,
consideration, courtesy and above all a spirit of public service, rather
than a display of arbitrary power. These are people on the other side of
the terminals. Remember that and remember the Golden Rule when you are
dealing with them.

&ADMIN DEFINITION
The administrators of this MUSH are the ones who work both in the
cultures and on a global level to keep this MUSH running as smoothly as
possible and to support players to make RP as easy and interesting as
possible for them. The admins on the MUSH do their work voluntarily, they do
not get paid for their work. They work as admins here simply because they
want to improve the environment that they play in themselves, and their only
reward is to see that their work is successful, or of course a pat on the
back from others who appreciate their work.

For a description of the duties and responsibilites of MUSH admins, read
'NEWS ADMIN DUTIES'.

&ADMIN DUTIES
There are some basic duties and responsibilities that are common to all
admins, no matter if they are global or cultural admins. The most important
guidelines for admins are summarized here, so if you are an admin,
please follow these guidelines, all of them are important.

Your main task on the MUSH is to facilitate RP and to make the MUSH in
general as easy and as interesting as possible for all players. Please
understand that though you should have fun with your work, you do your
work for the players. Most other guidelines here are directly derived from 
these rules.

Try to set a good example for the players. This means that you should try to
act like you would expect it from a good player.

No matter which admin rank you have, please never forget, though your
position gives you special powers, you are also still a player on the MUSH,
so treat all other players or admins on lower levels like you would 
expect to be treated by admins on a higher level yourself.

Please read 'NEWS ADMIN DUTIES 2' for more information.

&ADMIN DUTIES 2
Try to be as helpful as you can, especially with newbies. Please try to
understand that new players often don't know anything about MUSHes, so do
not get angry at them if they ask the same question two or three times.

Also, try to make newbies feel 'at home' here. When they page you, please
try to take some time for them. It often takes new players a lot of courage
to page someone for the first time, and if you are the first person they 
page, and the only answer they get is, 'I don't have any time for you', 
then you might also be the last person they page.

Try to keep track of the bulletin boards and policy changes when they are
being announced.

Please tell the admins on the higher levels about all problems, suggestions, 
ideas and complaints that you might have. They want and need your input. And
if you receive input from admins on lower levels, consider it carefully and
do not just ignore it.

But never forget: Have fun with your admin work. The moment that you notice
that you can not have any fun as admin anymore is probably the moment that
you should give it up, though hopefully it will never come that far.

Please read 'NEWS ADMIN DUTIES 3' for more information.

&admin duties 3
To summarize the duties of the admins on Beleriand, please remember the
following: 1) As an admin you have a duty to keep the needs of the players
and the game foremost in your mind. 2) The safety of the MUSH is
paramount. 3) You must conscientiously fulfill the durites and
responsibilities that are assigned to your position. 4) You are a player
as well as an admin, so have fun and enjoy yourself. These duties will be
made easier if you strive to always be aware of the most current policies
governing Beleriand and work to enact those policies fairly and equitably.

Please read 'NEWS ADMIN RESPONSIBILITES' for more information.
& admin responsibilities 
Whatever area you are posted to handle, you should be aware that it is
given to you both as a privilege and an obligation. It matters not if you
are a Wizard or a Royal or a Culture Admin, you have a task to perform and
if you cannot then it is your duty to say that you can't. What we cannot afford 
above all is stagnation; the game cannot afford for anyone to take on jobs
and tasks that they cannot do. Whatever the reason is, for the fact that a
job or a task cannot be done it is yours to keep for yourself, there's no
shame in saying that you cannot handle a certain task and you need not
tell why. In fact, if you show that you yourself know when it is time to
let go of a task, then all the more credit to you for being so clear in  
perceiving that this work shouldn't belong with you. Speak to a higher
rank admin about it and that admin will surely provide you with
assistance.  Don't cling to something you know you can't handle.  

(Continued in Rules Admin Responsibilities 2)  
============================================================================
& admin Responsibilities 2 
On the other hand, there's no point in giving up too early either! Try,
and try again. When it becomes clear after you have tried your best, then
why 
not ask for some help? We are all in it together and none of us are capable 
of doing EVERYTHING there is to do. We have our weak sides, so let's help
each other and 
improve. In a way, admins are the ones to benefit the most from MUSHing,
we 
learn more then the players ever will. We see all the facets and all the 
dark and light sides of people and of MUSHing. We are a privileged few...
Know when to go calling on your superiors.  If a problem arises that 
you have not encountered before (even though you may guess well at how it 
should be handled), investigate into the matter and  before any, BEFORE
ANY, 
action is taken to repair the situation, please ask your fellow admins at 
your own level if something like this has happened before and what was done 
then. We are supposed to be fair and our judgments consistent. If 
there's no one to ask, or if there hasn't been a mention of this before,
then drop 
a line to one of your superiors about the problem. If the solution is urgent 
and the problem has to be taken care of at once and you have none to ask, 
then you are on your own. Use your best common sense and try your best. Be 
ready to give an account of what you thought and how you reasoned, as well
as 
what solution you applied to the problem. Your superiors are not without 
understanding, far from it, they know what you're going through. They've 

been there themselves you know. 
============================================================================ 
&admin resources 
Among the Global Admins (GA's) there are people who have been appointed 
especially for deep and solid knowledge in the fields of, Theme, Combat, 
RP...etc.. Make use of them! (-Admins gives you their 
specialities) Give them a page with any kind of question, or better yet, 
first use the channel that is assigned to the topic you are wondering 
about. You may get what you want that way, it's not all that hard to do and 
it saves the GA's a bit of work. They are there for you but that doesn't 
mean they ain't without things to do. When in doubt, page a GA.  Another
service that the game provides MUSHwide are the ARBITERS, led by the
Archarb's. They are assigned to solving combat RP and 
theme issues as judges in disputes. You have the right to consult one at 
anytime concerning an issue you may have. Be prepared though, it may take
some time for a final decision, for 
often the ARB will need (and want) to consult with others. 
============================================================================
&ADMIN LEVELS
There are two groups of admins on Beleriand: Cultural Admins (CA) and
Global Admins (GA). These groups are subdivided into several
ranks. For information about these groups and the admin ranks, read the
following news files:

Cultural Admins: NEWS ADMIN CA
Global Admins:   NEWS ADMIN GA

&ADMIN CA
There are six different cultural admin positions. It is left to the culture
wardens to fill these positions or not. Players can be on more than one
position, and there can be more than one player on all positions except the
CW and CV positions, and all CAs would always do some CS work. It is left to 
the culture wardens to redefine the tasks and responsibilities that come 
with the admin positions in their cultures, though if they do so, it is 
their duty to inform the other CAs of their decision, otherwise the 
following definitions will apply:

Culture Warden (CW):
The culture warden is the manager or governor of a culture. The CWs make all
decisions about theme in their cultures, they have to approve tinyplots, 
they appoint or remove other cultural admins in their cultures and appoint 
them to their tasks. It is the CW's task to make it clear to the CAs what is 
expected of them, and it is the CWs task to communicate as much as possible 
with the CAs and the CAs have to communicate as much as possible with their 
CWs. The CWs are also the only ones who can decide which players get the 
password for their cultural builder character. It is also left to them to 
decide if a player can be a member of their cultures or not. The GAs will 
not interfere with the CWs' decisions unless there are, in the final
opinion of the GAs, very good reasons.

For more information, read 'NEWS ADMIN CA 2'

&ADMIN CA 2
Culture Vice Warden (CV):
The vice warden has the full rights of the warden if either there is no 
warden in the culture, or the warden is not available for a longer time, for
example when the warden goes on vacation, but if this is the case, then
either the warden or the global admins will explicitly ask the vice warden 
to act as warden till the warden returns. To let others know that the CV is
acting as temp CW, it is suggested that CWs set the vacation flag on
themselves when they have to leave the MUSH for a longer time. If the CW is
available, the CV will basically have the same rights and tasks as a normal
CA, and might even have another CA position (i.e. CC, CB, CT or CS).
Usually however, the CV will be the most important counsellor for the CW.

Culture TP coordinator (CT):
The TP coordinator's task is to come up with TP ideas or to collect them,
submit them to the CW for approval, plan the TPs and coordinate them when
they are running. One note: It does not mean that nobody else can work on TP
ideas if there is a CT in a culture. All players should always be able to
come up with TP ideas, in which case the CT would be there to offer help and 
counsel.

For more information, read 'NEWS ADMIN CA 3'

&ADMIN CA 3
Culture Coder (CC):
The culture coder codes and maintains the local code on the ZMO. For that,
the CC should usually be able to modify the ZMO. The CC would also be the
one to code objects that might be needed for RP in the culture, or it would
at least be the CC's task to supervise the work on these objects, and 
assist the players who code them when they need help.

Culture Builder (CB):
The culture builder not only builds things in the culture, but also
supervises the building work of others, and assists where help with building
is needed. The CB usually knows the password of the builder character.

Culture Support (CS):
The culture support admins do the day-to-day admin work, they mostly culture 
new players and help them. The CS rank is not really a lower rank than CC,
CT, CB and CV, all the other admins, even including the CW, would do CS work
too, they just have additional responsibilities.

&ADMIN GA
The global admins usually don't involve themselves in cultural affairs, but
maintain the MUSH itself. There are two different 'ranks' for global admins 
which differ mostly in the powers they have.

Wizards: The wizards can not only examine but also modify every object
(including players) on the whole MUSH. It goes without saying that the
wizards should use their powers wisely.

Royals: The powers of royals are more limited, they basically have a subset
of wizard powers. They can examine all objects, but cannot modify them 
unless they control them, and they can teleport anywhere. They also do not
need money, and are not affected by quotas. Though they are not as powerful
as wizards, they should still use their powers responsibly.


&ADMIN ADVANCEMENT
This section describes how a player becomes an admin, and how players can
move up from one level to the other. Everyone should keep in mind, that
being an admin is a responsibility and not a reward, and gaining admin
positions or advancing to higher admin positions is not the purpose of this
game. If you become an admin, it should be to work for the MUSH and the
players, but not to achieve power over others. Usually, the admins who have
to appoint other admins will notice if a player is doing exceptional work,
and then promote the player. A good rule of thumb is that people should be
promoted to a position when they are already doing the work for this
position, though there are other factors that have to be considered, for
example how well the new admin would fit into the existing admin team. 

There are basically four different admin 'levels' to which a player can 
advance: Cultural Admin, Culture Warden, Royal and Wizard. To find out 
how a player can advance to one of these admin levels, please read 
'NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 2'.
============================================================================ 
&admin advancement 2 
When a Culture Admin (CA) is to be appointed, the suggestion will go to the 
Culture Warden (CW) and the cultures CA staff, so they can all agree that 
the player should be raised to CA status in their culture. An ordinary
player may be appointed CA if he shows a will to contribute, shows the 
online time, the engagement and has contributed in a special way to the
gain of the culture. To what position is of course based on need and the  
suitability of the particular player. It is possible to have several CA's
of the same type, more then one Culture Coder (CC) for instance. A Global  
Admin is appointed by the GA's, choosing a player who has shown
him(her)self  to be able to handle the Mush topics in some special way,
that player often is expert at some area to which he is appointed to
handle. One does not apply to become one, one may be recommended by others
to become GA or picked by the GA's and offered the chance to become one. 

Please type 'NEWS ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 3' for more on this topic 
============================================================================ 
&ADMIN ADVANCEMENT 3
Cultural Admin:
The cultural admins (CV, CC, CT, CB and CS) for a culture are appointed 
(and removed if necessary) by the culture warden of this culture. The CWs
are totally free in their decisions, though it is suggested that they talk
to their CAs before they appoint another CA, to make sure that the CAs will
be able to work together as a team.

Culture Warden:
The culture wardens are appointed only by the global admins, though they
will of course listen to the opinions of the CAs in the culture. Usually,
the CV will be the first choice when the CW spot has to be filled, though
the GAs can also choose someone else.

Royal:
The wizards and royals vote on new royals.

Wizard:
The wizards vote on new wizards.

&ADMIN RECRUITING
First of all it should be said that recruiting should not be a competition
between the cultures. Try to find out if a new player will really be happy
in your culture, or else we might lose new players from the MUSH when they
find out that they are not having fun. It will help your culture more to
show new players how to join another culture where they might be more happy
and where they will RP, than dragging newbies into your culture when this is
not the place where they can find the RP that they were looking for. This
does not mean that you can't try to make your culture look good, but the
helpful recruiter will usually be the most successful recruiter, even if
being helpful means that you have to help newbies who decide to go to other
cultures. Helping new players will always pay off in a way, no matter if the
new players join your culture or not.

Also, try to be patient. On a MUSH, it is not 'The early bird catches the
worm', but 'The early recruiter scares them off'. Please don't page newbies
before they join the <Newbie> channel, unless they page you and ask for
help. Many new players are very insecure at first when they join a MUSH, and
it might scare them off if they get a lot of pages right after they connect,
especially since they might not know how to page yet. Also, when they are
on the <Newbie> channel, try to be polite and not too spammy.

&admin recruiting 2
Anyone can understand a player/admin wanting to recruit more people for his 
culture. Every culture should advise it's players on how the correct ways of 
recruiting are done.   First of all, be very patient. To a newbie this is 
very confusing stuff, try and add as little as possible to that confusion. 
If there are other players talking in the same room please page them (so as 
not to disturb the newbie) and try and get them to understand that spam is 
not what the newbie needs. Clear, concise, precise answers. Be gentle and 
warm towards him/her, no point in being anything else. And DO NOT brag and 
boast about your culture (Your culture might be wonderful but don't irritate 
and offend with your views, instead impress and ask the newbie to come see 
for him/herself instead), HELP the newbie find a home, ANY home, in which 
he/she can be happy.   

(Continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 3)
============================================================================ 
&admin recruiting 3
There is absolutely no point in recruiting someone that will be unhappy with 
your culture. Far better to talk awhile to the newbie and try and figure 
out what the newbie really wants to do here...what kind of character he 
wants to play and what race, what he/she would like to do in Beleriand...and 
so on. The newbie doesn't need a sales rap, he needs HELP! Confusing newbies 
is a good way to get tagged as a troublemaker, don't try and recruit newbies 
if you know you have a problem being clear in what you say...  As an admin 
of your culture you are to look out for people who have a known trouble 
recruiting newbies and restrain those efforts and redirect their energies. 
Your culture gains by it, the mush gains by it. Be gentle, for the players 
that are trying to recruit only wants the best for the culture, even if they

This is what you should do, or something that's close to this when a newbie 
comes on and doesn't know what to do. LISTEN first, ALWAYS listen to 
the newbie.  Ask if he/she needs some help or information, that you are 
willing to help out should he/she want it. Ask if he/she has any cultures in 
mind to join. If the newbie doesn't want help, leave him/her alone with the 
offer to talk anytime, especially about your home culture. IF he/she is 
uncertain about what to do, talk some more about what the newbie wishes to 
do on Bel, what type of race and character he/she wishes to play. Try and 
find out his/hers interests and skills. If you find he likes beards, loves 
axes and hates orcs recommend the newbie to become a dwarf. You get the 
picture? Don't try and sweet-talk the newbies, support them and enlighten 
them on what your home culture is, what the possibilities are there and by 
all means, be friendly and very patient. If they want to talk about the rest 
of Bel then do so. We are players on the mush first and foremost. 
When the MUSH gains a new playes so do we, if we get one to our culture 
then double is the joy. (Continued in NEWS ADMIN RECRUITING 5) 
============================================================================ 
&admin recruiting 5
If the newbie wants to join then bring him/her to your home and show 
him/her around. Tell the newbie about the regular help and -help files, the 
local help-files, about the -mail system (be sure he/she at 
least understands how to access it thru -help -mail) and also about the 
bulletin boards. (And how to access those...-skim, -read and so on. The 
local-BB, Public-BB are the most important.) Try to spread this 
information out, ask him/her how long time they have and give the 
information piece-meal. Ask them to write it down. Tell the newbie that 
if he/she does want to join they'll have to wait until a CA can -culture 
them. Warn them that they will not be able to participate in any IC events 
until they have (either done these things that are listed here or fulfilled 
your cultures own list of things to do) made a desc for themselves, made up 
a background story (neither of these need be very long but both has to be 
approved of by a CA before the newbie can go RP) and they have to find a 
suitable job. 
============================================================================ 
&admin newbie help 
Your newbie help inside the cultures MUST be excellent, your newbie supply
must be treated delicately...it's worth more than gold. If you as a
culture are to live on you have to rely on new players to come in. Good
newbie help is thus VITAL! Imagination, creativity...come on! Make your
newbie help more than 3 pages of dreary looking information...don't bore
the newbie into quitting the game. Bind his/her interest fully with fun
and interesting things to do...offer them plenty of choices, make their
entry into the game as smooth as you possibly can. Helping newbies is the
number one priority! Try and understand them and for the best of the MUSH,
try and spread good ideas around. This is not the time to sit back and
enjoy bright ideas inyour own culture, we will benefit on the whole, by
gaining more players all over the MUSH, rather then getting only the tenth
player that happens to find it's way to your great idea. Share! If all do
the same, then there will be a time when a newbie can come online and with
a little bit of energy be RPing as a full player inside a few days time!
 
  
============================================================================
&admin resigning
This can occur if you as an admin are inactive, if a admin behaves wrongly
and won't respond to correction, if an admin abuses his privileges, or if
an admin cannot handle his job. It does not matter if it was by intent or
not if the admin does not change after repeated warnings. Removing an
admin from a post is something that no one is pleased about; it is not a
plesant thing to do. A thing that
hopefully never needs to be done. But it will be done if needs be for the
best of the MUSH!  There is no excuse not to pay heed to warnings which
have been received repeatedly, any admin will first be asked why and what
he is doing in a nice way, what then is heard will perhaps lead to a kind
warning, then a more severe warning, followed by a final word. Then,
demotion. The stability of the MUSH is paramount, we are here for the MUSH
and it's hundreds of players...not for the amusement of the admins.
Complaints from any Admin who deems himself being treated unfairly will be
listened to and examined, just as any player's complaints will be examined
as well.

& building
===== RULES BUILDING =========================================================
In order to improve the quality and consistency of the MUSH, we have some
building guidelines which we insist that everyone adhere to. Construction may
be inspected by the admins, and you may be required to rebuild (or even 
destroy) work if it does not meet approval. You should always have admin
approval before creating any new rooms or exits.

The following subtopics are available:

  DESCRIPTIONS   -- General guidelines for writing descriptions
  EXITS          -- Specific guidelines for exits
  ROOMS          -- Specific guidelines for rooms
  TIPS           -- Miscellaneous tips you might find helpful

Type "RULES BUILDING <subtopic>" for information on a subtopic.
==============================================================================

& building descriptions
==============================================================================
It's hard to say what constitutes a perfect description, but here are some
general guidelines and rules which you should try to adhere to:

*) Most importantly, your descriptions should describe what a player *sees*.
   It should not convey information that the character cannot determine by
   looking around - neither the player nor the character is psychic.  

   It also should not try to think for the player, or dictate what the player 
   would feel in that spot.  Provide the cues - but let the player decide how 
   to act on them.  Remember that the way a character might react to something
   may depend a lot on their species or culture!  An orc's idea of art may
   be an elf's idea of grisly horror.

*) Avoid words which convey little information, particularly generic adjectives
   like "beautiful", "ugly" and so forth.  Instead, provide vibrant details
   which help the player to feel like he is really there.  "You are in a 
   beautiful garden" is not as good as a description which mentions the
   bright red roses, the little fragrant purple blossoms on the vines
   going up the walls, and the white marble fountain in the center.

==============================================================================

& building descriptions 2
==============================================================================
... Guidelines for good descriptions, continued ...

*) Use good English. Avoid colloquialisms. Check your spelling.  Bad language
   and misspelling become irritants if you have to see them every time you
   pass through a room.  More significantly, many of our players are not 
   native English speakers, and can be severely confused by grammatical
   errors or just overly colloquial phrasing.

   Have players who are known for good descriptions proof your work and
   offer advice.  It's very hard for anyone to judge their own writing.

*) As a general rule, avoid putting the descriptions of NPCs into the
   descriptions of rooms and exits.  If you are describing a busy location
   such as a marketplace, you might mention the general hubbub and that
   many folk are present, but you should not go so far as to describe
   individuals present.  You may wish to create a puppet to put in the room
   if you want to have an NPC which stands out from the crowd.

Continued in RULES BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 3 ...
==============================================================================

& building descriptions 3
==============================================================================
... Guidelines for good descriptions, continued ...

*) Don't use the ANSI color codes in your descriptions.  You can use the
   'hilite' attribute if you want, but use it sparingly. If you do use 
   highlighted text (boldface), put the highlighted phrase in quotation
   marks as well, for the benefit of those people who are not set ANSI.
 
   The reason for avoiding color is that even if the player's terminal
   supports ANSI and COLOR, you don't know what the actual colors are.
   (Just because the MUSH calls a color "red" for example doesn't really
   mean it's going to be red on everyone's screen: the ANSI control code
   really means something akin to "select color 3", and there is no absolute 
   mapping of color numbers to colors).  Also, depending on what a player 
   uses as their background color, you could end up with text displayed in
   the same foreground and background colors (effectively just looking like
   colored blocks on the screen).

*) Don't use tabs "%t" for formatting - people can have different tabstop 
   settings and what works on one terminal won't look right on another.

Continued in RULES BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 4 ...
==============================================================================

& building descriptions 4
==============================================================================
... Guidelines for good descriptions, continued ...

*) Use blank lines to separate paragraphs in long descriptions.  Don't
   indent paragraphs though.  This is really just a stylistic convention
   we have adopted for this MUSH; other ways are equally valid but we
   ask you do it this way on this MUSH.

*) Don't make any assumptions about the width of the player's terminal -
   in particular, don't try to line things up in columns by inserting spaces
   and depending on where the line wraps.  If you are doing something which
   really needs to have tabular data (that is, text aligned in columns),
   then force line breaks by including "%r" in the text, and limit the 
   width of individual lines to 78 characters (79 in a pinch, but never use
   80 because some terminals will automatically wrap when you print in
   column 80 whereas others only wrap when you try to print the 81st character.
   This results in things which look right on some terminals coming out
   double-spaced on others.)
==============================================================================

& building exits
==============================================================================
There are four basic attributes which any properly done exit will have:

*) All exits MUST have an @OSUCCESS and @ODROP.  

   The @OSUCCESS and @ODROP messages should enable people in the room to follow
   behind you easily, or know where you arrived from.

*) All exits SHOULD have an @SUCCESS and @DESCRIBE as well.  If an exit is
   set TRANSPARENT, then it must have an @DESCRIBE.  It is very confusing
   to see "You see nothing special." followed by the description of a room.

   For outdoor locations, the @SUCCESS message should provide a hint to the 
   player about how far or long they have travelled, to aid them in working
   out their IC travel time.

*) Do NOT put an @ODESCRIBE on an exit.  This just generates useless noise
   which everyone has to see whenever a player looks at an exit.

& building exits 2
==============================================================================
--- Exit naming and aliases ---

This is a controversial area, and opinions differ widely.  Nonetheless, we have
adopted a particular style and expect everyone to adhere to it.  We do not do
this because one style is inherently better than another, but simply to 
maintain a certain level of consistency across the MUSH.  Our guidelines and
requirements for exit naming are:

*) Exits should have a "full" name and normally should also have one or more
   aliases.  The "full" name is what the player sees when he looks around the
   room.  It should be complete words.  The exit may have any number of
   "aliases" as well, these are additional names for the exit which are 
   separated from each other by semicolons ";".  As an example:

       @name <exit> = Oak Door;Out

Continued in RULES BUILDING EXITS 3 ...
==============================================================================

& building exits 3
==============================================================================
... RULES BUILDING EXITS, continued ...

*) Case is not significant to the MUSH parser (you can use upper- or lowercase
   to go through an exit), but we do use capitalization to provide hints about
   alias names.  If you take all the capital letters from the full name of the
   exit, this should be one of its aliases.  Hence, for the above example we
   should actually have:

       @name <exit> = Oak Door;OD;Out

*) Exit aliases should include any "obvious" short forms for the full name.
   If an exit name is multiple words, then usually the first word alone should
   be a valid alias.  To continue with our example name, "Oak" and "Door"
   are probably good aliases:

       @name <exit> = Oak Door;Oak;Door;OD;Out


Continued in RULES BUILDING EXITS 4 ...
==============================================================================

& building exits 4
==============================================================================
... RULES BUILDING EXITS, continued ...

*) Compass directions should always include the obvious abbreviations:

      Northeast;NE  North;N  Northwest;NW  West;W  
      Southwest;SW  South;S  Southeast;SE  East;E
      Up;U          Down;D

   You do not need to capitalize the second part of compound compass
   directions in the full name of an exit.  In other words, just use 
   "Northeast" and not "NorthEast".

*) If there is an obvious main exit from a room, or only one exit for
   for a room, then it should include the aliases "Out;O".


Continued in RULES BUILDING EXITS 5 ...
==============================================================================

& building exits 5
==============================================================================
... RULES BUILDING EXITS, continued ...

*) Avoid exit names which match MUSH commands, or common abbreviations for
   MUSH commands.  In particular, avoid the following abbreviations for exits:

      P,PA  B,BR  L,LO, I,IN

   The reason for this is that these are also abbreviations for commonly
   used MUSH commands (PAGE, BRIEF, LOOK, INVENTORY) and the MUSH command 
   interpreter matches commands you type against exit names before MUSH 
   commands.  If for example you type "LO" to look around, you'll go 
   through the "LO" exit instead!

   "IN" is an unfortunate case, since it seems to be a perfect complement
   to "OUT".  Avoid it just the same.


Continued in RULES BUILDING EXITS 6 ...
==============================================================================

& building exits 6
==============================================================================
... RULES BUILDING EXITS, continued ...

*) If you have an exit alias which is not derivable from the rules described
   previously, then include the alias name in angle brackets "<>" as part of
   the full name:

        @name <exit> = Oak Door <Gate>;Oak;OD;Gate

   In fact, the above example is not sufficient.  If you have a full name
   which includes an alias in "<>", then you must also provide an alias
   which is the full name without the part in "<>":

        @name <exit> = Oak Door <Gate>;Oak Door;Oak;Gate;OD

   The reason for this is that if the player were to type the full phrase
   "Oak Door", it would not work if you didn't include the alias, because
   the name for the exit was "Oak Door <Gate>" and the MUSH parser will NOT
   automatically recognize "Oak Door" as an abbreviation!  The MUSH parser
   is inconsistent in this regard, since other commands like "GET" certainly
   *do* match partial strings.

*) Do NOT include an alias name in "<>" if it's an "obvious" abbreviation.
==============================================================================

& building rooms
==============================================================================
*) All rooms MUST have a description.  Normally this is in the @DESCRIBE
   attribute.  There is one special case where you might have the attribute
   in the @SUCCESS attribute instead, see RULES BUILDING TIP 1 for details.

*) If you set the AREANAME attribute on the room, this name will show up
   as your location when a player does a "-who".  The "-who" (and other
   commands) will first check for an AREANAME on the room itself, and 
   then on the ZMO for that room.  Normally AREANAME is only set on the
   ZMO, but you might find it convenient to override it with a local
   ARENAME on the room.

*) All rooms should be set TRANSPARENT, unless there is a good reason not
   to. What happens when a room is set TRANSPARENT is that the exits are 
   shown with the name of the room they lead to. This makes it easier for 
   newbies, as well as not so newbies, to find their way around. However, 
   there may be reasons that this format may not fill the needs of the 
   builder, for what he is trying to create. In that case, it is left to 
   the discretion of the CW of the culture if it is used. But in general,   
   it is a good convention to follow for the reasons above.

& building tips
==============================================================================
We want everyone to be able to get a quick start on building and know that 
there are lots of tips and tricks which people have learned which we'd like
to share.  If you have got anything which you'd like to contribute, send
your tip to Fingolfin, and he may include it here.

The following building tips are available.  To read any particular tip,
use "RULES BUILDING TIP ##", where "##" is the appropriate tip number.

TIP 1:  Making a room description which is different for a person in the room
        versus a person looking through an exit into the room.
==============================================================================

& building tip 1
==============================================================================
TIP:  Making a room description which is different for a person in the room
      versus a person looking through an exit into the room.

Usually, when looking through a tranparent exit, you are trying to see who 
is in the target room, and not the full description of the room itself.  
Here's a building trick for you which makes this easy to do, based on the 
following two items:

   If you have @DESCRIBE and @SUCCESS on rooms, a player in the room will see
   both the @DESC and @SUCC messages (in that order).

   If you have TRANSPARENT exits looking into a room, then when a player
   looks through the exit, they will see only the room's @DESC.

Put the room's description in the @SUCC instead of the @DESC attribute.
Then, players looking through an exit into the room will not see the 
room description, but players in the room itself will.  In the description
for the exit itself you can put a shortened description of the target room.
Players looking through the exit will see the short description (which is
really the exit's description but will look like the target room's
description instead), followed by the contents of the room.

CODING PUPPETS - how to code puppets

==============================================================================

& coding puppets
==============================================================================
Puppets are objects which represent animals, non-player-characters, and 
other similar sorts of creature.  Usually these objects have the PUPPET flag
set, so that they relay what they see and hear to the player who owns them,
though for the purposes of this discussion that is not a requirement.

Puppets are allowed on this MUSH, with some restrictions:

1) Puppets cannot be used as combatants, except by special admin approval.
   Players may RP combat (or anything else for that matter) with puppets 
   if all parties agree (for example, several elves could fight with a warg 
   puppet). 

2) As a general rule, animals should be considered "ordinary" - your dog or
   horse is a typical member of the species.  Animals should not "talk" or 
   exhibit overly intelligent behavior, nor do they have psychic links to 
   their owners. In particular, puppets may not be used as spy objects. 
   What you see through the eyes of a puppet is not to be considered IC  information.
   Use common sense when deciding what an animal can do - no matter how well
   you've trained it, a falcon isn't going to fly 500 leagues and pick a 
   random person out of a crowd to deliver a message (on the other hand, a
   trained homing bird might legitimately travel between two fixed locations).

Continued in RULES CODING PUPPETS 2 ...
==============================================================================

& coding puppets 2
==============================================================================
... continued from RULES CODING PUPPETS ...

3) Puppets which represent pets should be limited to fairly "standard"
   sorts of domestic animals, like dogs, cats, horses, etc.  They should
   certainly be chosen as something appropriate to your culture.  If you
   want to step outside these bounds, make sure to clear it with an admin.

4) Puppets should not be used in lieu of real characters.  For example, if 
   you need to send a messenger from one culture to another, send an actual
   player if at all possible.  Puppets should be used as general NPCs only
   by special approval.

5) Puppets may be used for NPC guards and sentries, heralds, or other forms
   of "static" character.  Usually these are set up by your local admins and
   are part of the local "scenery" of the location you are in.  

   If you are travelling and encounter such a puppet (like a sentry), you
   should try to determine what culture or player that puppet belongs to,
   and how to interact with it.    

Continued in RULES CODING PUPPETS 3 ...
==============================================================================

& coding puppets 3
==============================================================================
... continued from RULES CODING PUPPETS 2 ...

6) With the exception of items like sentries, you should make sure to put any
   puppets you have away before logging off.  If you have a horse, you should
   stable it.  If you have a dog, you probably should just pick it up before
   you disconnect.  Don't leave your pet just sitting in a room, especially
   if that room is a high-traffic area!

   You may find it useful to include commands in your @ADISCONNECT which will
   @teleport a puppet of yours back into your inventory automatically when
   you disconnect.

7) If you have a pet, RP it!  Don't just pull it out of your pocket as an
   occasional prop when you aren't otherwise noted for having one.  For
   example, unless you normally wander around with your hunting falcon, you
   shouldn't just suddenly have a hunting falcon when it's convenient.

==============================================================================
& combat Role Play
The primary purpose of the combat system is to act as an impartial judge 
between a group of two or more players engaged in combat RP. The combat 
system is by NO means a substitute for Role-Play. In fact while combat RP
does not require using the combat system, role-play is essential when using
the combat system. Beleriand is not a Dungeons and Dragons simulation. The 
game is most fun when poses are vivid and descriptive, using the results of 
the combat system as a cue to guide the direction of role play. Players who 
fail to role play while they use the combat system will be ruled against in
any arbitrating decision and may have their combat privileged taken away.

Please see  NEWS COMBAT FAQ  for information on becoming combat approved
& combat stats
==============================================================================
A brief primer on what the individual stats mean to your character, in
alphabetical order:

CONstitution - This indicates the general health and 'well being' of your 
character. A higher constitution value means your character will heal from 
wounds faster. In addition higher CON might mean battle wounds are less 
hindering.

DEXterity - The 'speed' of a character. This stat affects your ability to
avoid being hit by a foe's weapon while increasing ability to hit the foe back.

INTelligence - Effects how quickly your character can learn and be -trained.
In addition how high and in how many weapons a player may have high training
in.

STRength - Quite obviously, how strong a character is. How hard they hit and
how much they can carry.

MAX-HP - An indication of how much damage a character can receive. MAX-HP can 
only be adjusted by Admins.

n-AC - Natural-AC. An indicator of the ability of the species to resist harm 
from weapons.
==============================================================================
&combat Beasts
Beasts are coded objects designed to interact with players in regards to the
Combat System on Beleriand, they range from such things as Guards of all
species to animals and monsters. These Beasts are available to the cultures
and, if a player has a good reason, to the players themselves. This however
is usually not the case as control over the Beasts is rather tight to avoid
manipulation of said objects. Direct ownership will be restricted, where it
is practical Culture Admins might get control over it for the sake of
simplicity.

Beasts are there to fill out the IC world and make it more real to interact
with, to create the illusion of the players interacting with other people
then just the players themselves. Hunting a Stag, scaring up and being
attacked by a Bear, running afoul of a dread Spider...In some cases, Beasts
may be created as 'background' for characters. Beasts are in all just the
'supporting cast' in this play we call Beleriand and as such, will not
compete with the true 'stars'. A Beast will not ever be as important as a
player and will not be more then a player, unless we are speaking Dragons or
something. Beasts are not there to give others a edge, they are there
because it would make sense to have them there/here in the IC world of Tolkien.

In general, requests should go through the Culture Admins first, then to
Thorondor/Other Wr's with a clear definition of the purpose of the Beast/s,
reasons and useages.

& COMBAT  FAQ TEST
Q: How do I get combat approved?
A: Every player is required to take a basic combat test to prove that
they are familiar with the combat system and are capable of RPing combat
in a realistic and thematic manner. To take it, the player must first go
to the Library located just off the OOC Hangout. There, the Auto-Arb
machine will generate the written part of the combat test. Copy the
questions down, and -mail them, along with your answers, to "Arbiters".
If possible, a player should include an idea of the times and days they
will be available to take the test in this -mail, so the ARBs can more
easily set aside a time for the second part of the test. It is highly
recommended that a new player prepare for the combat test by becoming
familiar with the NEWS COMBAT and -help combat information, and by
hopefully practicing combat RP with their culture's -trainers,
features, or admins.

Q: What is the test like?
A: The Fighter Test is consists of two sections: The written quiz, and a
roleplayed combat scene. The written part is made up of questions designed
to test the player's familiarity with the NEWS COMBAT and -help combat
files, as well as questions regarding the basics of Beleriand theme. The
second part of the combat test is usually held in one of the OOC Combat
arenas, and consists of an entirely roleplayed scene involving combat. It
is the ARBiter's job to decide if the player has the necessary RP skills
to handle combat believably and thematically, and to hopefully offer
suggestions on what the player can do to improve these skills.

Type NEWS COMBAT FAQ TEST 2 for more.
& COMBAT  FAQ TEST 2

Q: How is the test graded?
A: The player taking the Roleplayed combat test is carefully evaluated
by the ARBiter giving it. It is the ARB's responsibility to decide
whether the player is in fact ready for the FIGHTER flag by gauging
their ability to RP combat thematically and realistically, and by
determining if the player is familiar enough with the rules and
etiquette of combat RP to merit receiving the FIGHTER flag. An ARBiter
pays attention specifically to the player's ability to visualize the RP
scene, their feel for timing concerning their own actions in relation
to others around them and the IC world itself, their sense of how
possible it is to hit and to wound in the situation at hand, what and
how much damage to take from a likely blow, and what kind of movements
are possible or impossible in armour of different types and in varying
conditions. It is the ARBiter's duty to help the player improve in these
areas by offering advise and suggestions during the test, or possibly by
recommending that the player take combat lessons on the subject in which
they are lacking. If the ARB feels that the player is not sufficiently
skilled in combat RP, or not familiar enough with basic MUSH theme and

& COMBAT  FAQ TRAINING

Introduction:
Over time, training increases your skill at using a weapon. All facets of
combat: ability to hit, accuracy and even defensive skills all are improved
with training. We endeavor to have training RP'd between student and trainer.
This allows the trainer to not only give some tips on weapons usage, but also
to display some good RP abilities and make sure the students ability to
project movements with words is improving. Some FAQ's:

Q: Who can I train with?
A: Any approved trainer who has greater skill in the weapon you wish to train
in. In general it should be a player in your culture, although if it happens
that another culture's trainer is nearby, it is okay if s/he agrees ICly to
train you. Going out of your way to find a trainer in another culture is
frowned upon. Being trained by a known IC enemy is even worse and will likely
result in both players losing privileges. If no trainer characters are available
in a player's general IC area for an extended period of time, it may possible to
hold training sessions in the OOC Combat Arena with an available -trainer, and
only if permission is granted by the player's Cultural admins.

& COMBAT  FAQ TRAINING 2

Q: How often may I train?
A: In theory, every couple of RL days a player may improve skills by training.
This depends on the students INTelligence. Those with average INT (100) will
benefit with -train's every few days, while those with more may train faster,
and likewise, those with less will need to wait more. Overall, staying active
with training sessions every six days with average intelligence will improve
one word level per RL month.

Q: Word Level? Huh?
A: The -training command will show you the current 'word levels' of your skills
in each weapon. These are in fact textual descriptions of a -range- that your
training falls into. Each 20 training points represents another word level, and
while you may not directly see the number of training points you have, each
successful -train does indeed improve your skills towards the next word level.
See "-Help Combat T L" for an illustration of Word Levels.

& COMBAT  FAQ TRAINING 3

Q: How many weapons can I -train in?
A: With the same limitations on waiting a couple of days between -training
sessions, you may train in any number of weapons available to you and your
culture. There is a limit, however, in how skilled you may become in multiple
weapons. While Expertise in Longsword and Bow is attainable over time for the
average player, expertise in three or more weapons is hardly possible. This
again depends on INTelligence, and the frequency of the player's -training
sessions.

Q: How may I become a trainer?
A: Trainers should firstly be good RPers and active to the point where they can
at least arrange training sessions with fellow players. It is up to each
culture's admins to choose who is capable of being a trainer in each culture.
It is hoped the above conditions apply of course. The game admins will only
become involved if there is a problem with the trainer.

& COMBAT  FAQ HEALING

Q: Who can use the -heal command?
A: While anyone may use the -heal command, only authorized healers who represent
those with IC skill will have a reasonable chance of success. Whether it is
successful or not, the -heal command can only be used on a given player once
per IC-day.

Q: What stats affect the chances of a -heal working? And how much healing will
 occur?
A: The skill of the healer and the CONstitution of the character who the heal is
used on are the greatest factors. In addition, the healers INTelligence and some
random factors play into both the chances of success and the amount (measured in
HP's) the player will increase by. There's one caveat: A healer must be in at
least fair health to be able to use the -heal command. Currently that number is
half of the healer's total HP's.

& COMBAT FAQ HEALING 2

Q: How do I become a healer?
A: Express the desire to your Culture Admins. Likely you will begin as an
apprentice, both in skills and position. After some time, you'll be a full
fledged healer with a good idea how to RP your important job.

Q: How does a healer improve his or her skill?
A: With each successful heal attempt, the healer gains a small amount of skill.
Over time, this increase can lead to higher word levels and abilities in
healing. Possibly in the future, highly skilled healers will be able to impart
healing skill based on some kind of training command.

Q: Are there other ways to heal?
A: Yes. Even without the aid of a healer, a player will begin to naturally
recover on the following IC day from when s/he was last attacked by anyone. In
general, such a recovery occurs much more slowly than under the care of a
skilled healer.

& COMBAT  FAQ DAMAGE 
A brief primer on how the combat system works:

A numbered 'range' is calculated for each player. It is a number greater 
than  0  and is a  function of each of the players DEXterity and training in 
the  weapon  they currently  wield. The exact weighting for this number is 
not quite  settled  on, but for now training  points contribute somewhat 
less than DEXterity in  this  figure. In addition a 'reach'  number is 
calculated for the attacker. This  number again is a function of the players  
training points and DEXterity. So  that leaves us with these values: 
          attack_range ... f(DEX,training)
          attack_reach ... f(training,DEX)
          defend_range ... f(training,DEX)
Now a random number is generated for each player between 0 and *_range for  
each  player.  In the case of the attacker his/her number will be between 0 
and   MIN(attack_range, defense_range). If the difference in these two 
numbers is  less  than  attack_reach - this attack has resulted in a hit and 
damage must now be  calculated.

Type  NEWS COMBAT FAQ DAMAGE 2  to see how damage is calculated.

& COMBAT  FAQ DAMAGE 2  
Now that we have a 'hit' number which is less than 'attack_reach', we can 
use  this number  to calculate damages. Firstly the 'brunt' of the attack is  
calculated as a percentage of  the difference between 'attack reach' and the  
'hit' number. This is multiplied by the  damage of the weapon. Then the  
damage  is further multiplied by weighted values of the  attackers STRength 
and  training. Finally it is divided by the defenders effective AC  (armour  
class)..which is in itself the defenders AC plus possible bonuses for  
training.   

So to try and put this in equation form:

hit = Rand(min(attack_range,defend_range) - defend_range))
damage = weapon_damage * (hit - attack_range) / attack_range
damage = damage * (f(attacker_STR) + f(attacker_training))
damage = damage / (defender_AC + f(defender_training))

& COMBAT RESOURCES
The list of current resources: ARROWS COINS HERBS LEATHER ORE WOOD are part  
of a  Basic  Resource System in which materials for weapons and armour are 
used  when  these things are  forged. It is a unit-less system designed to 
facilitate  trade  and other IC interactions. (More to come)

& COMBAT TRAINING LEVELS 
Thorondor and Nienna had a discussion as soon as I got back on line as far 
as what to set  as -training levels for the different groups. The following is  
what  they came up with, as  a starting place only. MMore data on how these 
levels work  in actual CS combat situation  is needed. To that end, I have 
been using 2 of  my  alts to test it out ICly.
        Please remember that the following levels were simply a place to  
start  at. They  will likely be changed to some extent, but as to which ones 
and how  much, I really can't  say yet, in all honesty. We'll try to make 
them as fair  as  possible to all the groups.  Some of this will require the 
help of a number  of  you, especially the FC2s. So here is  what they are 
for right now:
        FC2 - 1 master and 2 expert (these may be adjusted manually and have 
been in some  cases, but they are still mostly adjusted not quite right)
        FC1 - 1 expert and 2 adept. 
        -trainers (non-fcs) - 1 adept and 2 proficient. (FCs are 
automatically  trainers,  since only they can -train the trainers and so 
they can  occasionally  train a regular player  - their levels do not 
increase, they get the -training skill as an extra responsibility)
        players - can have two weapons. The first training gives a bonus, so 
that most  players start in the jr.apprentice levels. A Player can be - 
trained  in one weapon about every 4 days with an INT of 100.
        CW (Military, non-FC, -trainer) - 1 expert, 1 adept, 1 proficient
        CW (non-military, non-fc, non-trainer) - 2 apprentice
        CW (anwhere in between the two ends of the range shown above, will 
have  training levels falling in between those two given above.

Type NEWS COMBAT TRAINING LEVELS 2  for more
& COMBAT TRAINING LEVELS 2
Okay, you've now seen the levels we are starting people out as, as far as  
weapons, except  for this last one:
        Head of Military (or whatever comes close to that) (non-fc, non- 
trainer)  - individual adjustment to the main weapon used, still only the 2 
weapons of  a  player.
        Now, for healing, we decided to set the healers at proficient or  
adept.  Master  level would be at the CW's request and can be used by them 
to reward  the  healer with the  best RP. 

& COMBAT VERSION
The code for the combat system was begun in November 1996. In January 1997
the code was changed and placed on Wizard level objects. After some delays,
and after moving Beleriand's site, the code was opened for public use around
March of 97. That was version 1.0, and like many so-called 'dot-ohs' it had 
its share of bugs, which at this writing are fixed. The current version is
called 1.5, which is more a representation of other features which have been
added than any particular event or release. A brief history of those changes 
and future versions follows:

Version	Date		Features
1.0		March 97	Forging, wielding, attacking, healing...
1.1		March 97	Bug fixes, encumbrance of weights
1.2 		April 97	Mostly internal changes
1.3		April 97	Healing and training modified
1.4		May 97	Attack command changes
1.5		May 97	More weapons, resources code enhanced
1.6		June 97   	Shoot command (bows), limited 'beta beasts'
				internal changes to forge 
1.7		October 97 	Enhanced attack command hunting beasts.
1.8         In Progress Many enhancements and tweakings.
1.9         Planning    More resources, resource objects
2.0		Dreaming	Possible introduction of attack weight
                        estimates.

Definition of Feature Characters (FC)
        What is a feature? It is a person who has shown great RP skills
and IC knowledge of the part, whether a character from the book or a
character of their own devising. Such a person will have also made
significant OOC contributions to their culture and the MUSH in terms of
taking a lead in fostering RP and generally helping out to make the MUSH
experience fun for all involved. Whether a person is playing their own
character or one from out of the book, in Beleriand, they will all be
referred to as FCs.

Type NEWS FEATURES DUTIES to read on
& features duties
Duties of Feature Characters
        Along with the fame and the glory and that pretty f of being an
FC, comes a number of duties and responsibilities. You were made an FC in
appreciation and recognition of your RPing skills and OOC contributions to
the MUSH. So you in turn will make it a point to RP with as many people as
possible, particularly with newer players. You are supposed to be an
example, which means being seen, ICly. FCs are required to maintain
connection times sufficient to qualify them as a Regular on -cultures, and
of their time online, at least half of it is to be IC time. By IC time it
is meant time in which you are not only in IC -mode, but also out actively
RPing.

Type NEWS FEATURES DUTIES 2 to read on

Duties of Feature Characters, cont.

      A certain standard of OOC behavior will be expected of FCs as well.
While all players are expected to be courteous to their fellow players at
all times, especially in pubic forums like the com system, this holds
doubly true for feature characters. You are the ones that the other
players look to for role models for both IC and OOC actions, and thus you
should always remain conscious of what sort of example you are setting for
others. Since so much of the RP life of a culture revolves around the FCs,
if an FC will be gone for some length of time for any reason, they must
notify their culture and any others that will be affected of the upcoming
absence. Even a significant drop in online time requires that they must
notify the same people. While a prolonged absence may require that someone
else will need to take over the part, this will be judged on a player to
player basis unless a need is found later to make some kind of official
ruling on this.

& features IC/OOC
IC/OOC Leaders and FCs

        Since there are sometimes communication problems between the IC
leader (the FC Head of the culture) and the OOC leader (the CW of the
culture) when they are two different people, we will try having both be
the same person whenever possible. Both of the Leader positions require
the player filling them to be very knowledgeable about theme and what is
IC for that culture, but the IC Leader also requires a knowledge of the FC
and good RPing skills also. If the IC Leader and the CW end up as two
different players, then the CW still has the final say in what is IC for
the culture.

Type NEWS FEATURESIC/OOC 2 to read on
& features IC/OOC 2
IC/OOC Leaders and FCs, cont.

        The position of CW will be given first and it is preferred that
the CW spend some time in that position before recieving any FC at all,
not just the culture's IC leader FC. The nominating and voting on awarding
the CW a FC is handled by the GAs, though they may often ask opinions of
fellow CAs of the CW nominee. Although the GAs attempt to choose CWs who
have all the qualifications necessary, adding Great RP skill to that list
is not always easy. However, a CW who recieves an FC other than the IC
Leader's, may still work their way up to that or a higher level FC from
that first awarded.
        It should be remembered that a CW may recieve an FC
other than the IC Leader FC for a variety of reasons that have nothing to
do with their level of RPing skill.

Type NEWS FEATURES LOSING to read on
& features losing
Losing an FC

        Revoking a player's feature flag is a serious business, and one
that shall not be taken lightly. The primary reasons for which the FC may

outlined in NEWS FEATURES DUTIES. The GAs and the player's CW will monitor
FCs activity and any of the above may move for revokation if they notice a
significant drop in activity, consistant IC conduct that is thematically
inappropriate for the character, or OOC behavior unfitting of a player
with FC status. In the case of IC behavior deemed thematically
inappropriate, the GAs and/or the CW of the player's culture shall have
the right to retcon any scenes in which the inappropriate behavior
occurred if they feel it necessary.

     If a majority of a panel consisting of the GAs and the player's CW
concur that the player is not upholding the duties, the GA(s) in charge of
FCs will send the player a warning notice of the impending removal of the
flag (and possibly character) if immediate improvement is not seen or
satisfactory explanation given for his or her non-compliance. If, after a
period of 14 days, the player has not provided such explanation or
improved upon his or her activity or behavior, another vote shall be
taken, at which time the flag will be removed if a majority still concur
that the action is warranted.

      In the hopefully unlikely event that a feature character does
something in flagrant violation of MUSH policies for player conduct, the
flag and/or character may be immediately revoked at the discretion of the
GAs without the above outlined voting process taking place. Depending on
the nature of the offense, the player may also be subject to other
punitive measures under the terms of the policy violated.

An FC Changing Cultures

        If a player who has an FC wishes to move to another culture, he or
she may do so. If the player holds a book FC, then he or she will need to
have the feature flag either transfered to an alt in that culture, or, at
the discretion of the CW of the culture being joined, may have his or her
character changed to another book FC who belongs to the new culture.
Players may also transfer their FC flag to an alt if they so desire,
without leaving the original FC culture, provided that the CW(s) of the
player's culture(s) agree to the change. When such a transfer takes place,
the player's primary character will become the one which bears the feature
flag and will be expected to log as much or more IC time as the new
primary as they do with the alt (the former primary).

An FC Changing Cultures

      In the case of non-book FCs, CWs may request that the player be
granted a book FC subsequent to the player receiving their FC. The
transfer of the FC flag for any of the above reasons may also result in
stat and training changes, either higher or lower, depending on the
particular characters involved. All such decisions will be at the
discretion of the Archarb(s).

Type NEWS FEATURES NOMINATING to read on
&features nominating
Nominating an FC

        All nominations for a player are to be sent to the CW of the
player's culture. The CW in turn will write up a nominating letter to the
GA(s) in charge of FCs (see -adm/jobs features). The CW will include in
this letter a list of 5 players he or she feels is familiar with the
player's RP ability and OOC qualifications for an FC. Of these names, 1
must be a GA and 4 must be FCs and/or CAs. The CW should have available
logs of the player's RP to be provided to the voters upon request.
        Once the application for the player has been sent to the GA(s) in
charge of FCs, he or she will in turn send letters to those named as
potential voters asking them to cast their vote for the person or to give
a reason why they feel unable to do so. Once the votes have been gathered
and tallied, the GA(s) will inform the nominating CW of the result, and,
if the FC was approved, arrange for an FCing ceremony to be held to
present the player with the feature.

Type NEWS FEATURES TEMPORARY to read on
& features temporary
Temporary Feature Characters

        If there is a need for an FC who has no player yet, the CW of that
culture may chose someone to play that FC for a short period of time.
While it is preferred that they choose a player from their own culture to
play the temporary FC, they may still ask or allow a player from another
culture to play the it. These characters shall not become the primary
character for the player, and ideally should be granted by the CW for a
specific purpose and a specific length of time, with the player
relinquishing the temporary FC at then end of this time and the character
remaining unplayed until needed again for some purpose.
         A player who is temporarily playing an FC will not have the name
locked to him, but will use the FC's name and end it a period, like this:
Beren. instead of Beren itself. Temporary features are to be considered
non-combat characters whoever they be, and as such will not receive a
fighter flag, FC level stats, or any special -training.
         Temporary FCs will be expected to conduct themselves as though
they were permanent features in terms of IC activity and OOC behavior, and
like permanent features must give notice if they will be absent or have
lowered connection times for a given time period. Any problems with this
will be looked at on a player to player basis. If it is seen that there is
a need for additional rules for this type of FC, then they will then be
added.

Type NEWS FEATURES VOTING to read on
& features voting 
FC Voter's Duties

        Those asked to vote on a player to receive a feature character
should respond to the vote request letter as promptly as they are able. If
a voter does not feel they can comment immediately on the player's
abilities, they may either request logs of the player's RP, RP with the
player as either themselves or as an alt, or they may ask to be excused
from the voting with an explanation of why they do not feel they can
objectively vote on the player. When considering their vote, voters should
take into consideration all aspects of the player's conduct, both ICly and
OOCly, and judge whether they feel them to be in compliance with the
standards of behavior expected of FCs.
         Votes can be either 'Yes' or 'No', both of which require an
explanation for the vote. This explanation should include a brief
discussion of why the voter feels the player is qualified for an FC on
both IC and OOC grounds.
         If one or more of the voters for a candidate withdraws from the
voting, the GA(s) in charge of FCs will contact the nominating CW to
request replacement name(s) for the abstaining voters. All reasons given
for 'No' votes will be investigated by the GA(s) in charge of FCs, and if
deemed compelling enough to refuse the FC request, can overturn even a
majority 'Yes' vote. In the absence of any such compelling reasons for
refusal, the player shall be granted the FC upon receiving a majority of
favorable votes.



&LANGUAGES
The language system on Beleriand might seem confusing at first, because it
does not only consist of 'pure' languages, but also of dialects, which can be
related to each other, and because a lot of language names appear in the
language list that do not appear in the Silmarillion. That is why these news
files were written, to explain the thematic ideas behind the language system
and to make it easier to understand how the languages can be used in RP.
When you read these news files, please understand that this has been a
controversial topic on Beleriand and has been discussed for quite some time
before the current language system was implemented. The current system
represents a consensus, and if you disagree with certain points, please keep
in mind that others might disagree with other points which might look
perfectly logical to you.

The languages on Beleriand can be divided into 6 categories. Read the
following subtopics for more information:
NEWS LANGUAGES COMMON                 NEWS LANGUAGES DWARVES
NEWS LANGUAGES ELVES                  NEWS LANGUAGES EVIL
NEWS LANGUAGES HUMANS                 NEWS LANGUAGES OTHERS

&LANGUAGES COMMON
The common language in Beleriand, the language that you speak when you
use the normal 'say' or 'pose' commands and not the language system
commands, is 'Beleriandic', which is a dialect of Sindarin. It can be
gathered from various sources that all species in Beleriand were able to
communicate with each other, and the most likely candidate for a common
language would be Sindarin. There are three other Sindarin dialects (as can 
be seen in 'NEWS LANGUAGES ELVES') which are of course related to
Beleriandic, so everyone will also have skills in the three other Sindarin
dialects. There might be exceptions of course, people who would not be able
to speak Sindarin at all, and it will be left to you to RP such a character,
though you should speak to your CW and CV first to see if they think that 
your decision makes sense.

&LANGUAGES DWARVES
Not much can be said about the language of the Dwarves. Their only language
on this MUSH is Khuzdul which is not subdivided into dialects. It should
only be mentioned that the Dwarves were more secretive about their language
than all other species, and they usually did not teach it to anyone and did
not speak it in front of others too often.

&LANGUAGES ELVES
The elvish languages are probably the most complicated part of the whole
language system. It is probably clear to everyone that the Noldor would
know Quenya, and the Laiquendi would speak Nandorin, but Sindarin is 
subdivided into three dialects (four if you count Beleriandic): Falathrin,
Mithrin and Iathrin. Falathrin is the dialect that is being spoken by the
people of the Falas, Iathrin is the dialect of Doriath and Mithrin is
originally the dialect that was spoken by the Elves of Mithrim, but which
was spread all over Beleriand later as the Noldor moved to their new realms
in the east and the south. All these dialects are related, so if you know
one dialect, you will also have some skills in the other dialects.

The dialect which is actually closest to Beleriandic, the 'common language'
of Beleriand, is Iathrin, because with Thingol claiming kingship over all of
Beleriand, it was probably the most important dialect in Beleriand before
the return of the Noldor. For more information on this topic, read 'NEWS
LANGUAGES COMMON'

Note: a small dictionary of common words in Quenya and Sindarin is
available.  See 'NEWS DICTIONARY ELVEN'.

&LANGUAGES EVIL
The Orcs took words from all languages and used them in their own uncouth
language. There were probably different dialects from tribe to tribe, though
at the moment, we only have one language for the Orcs in the language system
here: Orkish

There is also a special language called Melkorin, which we consider to be
Melkor's 'corrupted' version of Valarin. This language would probably not be
spoken by a simple Orc, and will be given out on a case-by-case basis.

&LANGUAGES HUMANS
To find out how the languages of the Humans would be related was easy, since
Beor himself gives us some exact information on this topic in the
Silmarillion. He said that his people (who live in Dorthonion) were 
sundered in speech from the Haladin (who now live in Brethil), but that the 
language of the people of Marach (who went to Dor-Lomin) is more like to 
theirs. We decided to call the three languages Beorian, Halethian (for the
Haladin) and Marachian, with Marachian and Beorian being closely related.

There are two other languages for the Humans: Eastron is the language of the
Easterlings, and Druic is the language of the Druedain.

&LANGUAGES OTHERS
There are two languages for restricted races: Eaglish for the Eagles and
Entish for the Ents. Though some might think that it would be more
appropriate to choose words in Sindarin for these language names, it was
decided that less confusing names would be chosen in these cases.

&LANGUAGES TEACHING
The language system on Beleriand allows language teachers to improve a
player's language stats by using the '-teach' command. There are several
important guidelines for language teaching though that each language teacher
should be aware of:

Language teaching should be RPed. There has to be some sort of IC language
lesson, or at least a longer IC meeting. Of course, doing a real language
lesson would be nearly impossible since hardly anyone would know too many 
words of Tolkien's languages, especially the more obscure ones. It is left 
to the language teachers to come up with ideas for their language lessons. 
Some real life knowledge of languages can help here.

All language teachers should be familiar with the background behind the
languages they know (see 'NEWS LANGUAGES'). They should also have IC reasons   
for knowing these languages.

Please read 'NEWS LANGUAGES TEACHING 2' for more information.

&LANGUAGES TEACHING 2
Languages should not be taught to anyone without good IC reasons. Language  
teachers who are approached by players for language lessons should ask these 
players to make sure that their characters would really be inclined to learn 
languages. It is not very 'in character' for a lot of characters to be
interested in languages at all. Language teachers should also ask themselves
if it makes sense to teach a certain language to a particular player.
Language teachers can always refuse to teach a player, and language lessons
should not be given out as favors, or to improve the language skills in the
teacher's culture, but only on a thematically reasonable basis.

==============================================================================
In this section we'd like to note the existence of software 'clients' that 
provide many features over so-called 'vanilla' Telnet programs. These are
programs that can be downloaded from sites on the Net for free or as shareware.

Some of the features include command editing, recall buffers, logging and 
cut & paste abilities, and many, many others. Some of the better clients 
available (with respective operating systems) are:

Microsoft Windows 3.1/95/NT
     MUSHclient     http://connexus.apana.org.au/~nick/version2.html
     zMUD, GMud

     MacMUSH
     Tinkeri

UNIX & OS/2
     TinyFugue (type NEWS MISC TF for some tips on using this client)

Here's a site with links for all kinds of clients for most operating systems:

& misc tf
==============================================================================
TinyFugue, or TF as it is commonly referred to, is a very nice telnet client
which is especially designed for uses with MUSHes and MUDs.  It offers a lot
of nice features, such as session logging, uploading mechanisms, macros, 
command recall and editing, ability to switch between worlds for folks who 
don't have windowing systems, "gagging", "triggering", etc.  If you are 
running some variant of Unix or even OS/2, and can figure out how to download 
and compile code, then check it out!  See "http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/".

Since so many people use TF, we have provided this section here to provide 
some handy tips and macros you might like.  Note that doing things via TF
macros is a lot less laggy than coding $commands on yourself!

&Advertising.
Advertising for other Mu*s is not encouraged  on Beleriand in any other form
then a @doing. At this time, Beleriand is growing but we still have not
achieved a large enough playerbase to have recruiters drop in and draw them
away. This may change as we grow further but, for the time being, we ask you
not to recruit players for other mu's over com channels (aside from anything
else, it's bad ethics really), through the -poll nor through the means of
paging unfamiliar people with this propostion in mind. 

By all means, use the  @doing and talk to your friends as normal but,
respect the efforts of the players on Beleriand who do their best to bring
people here. Thank you for helping Beleriand to grow.
&ALTS
A player may play a second character on the MUSH in order to experience a
different culture and to provide him or herself with more opportunity for
RP.  Players are allowed the maximum of one alternative character, though
admins of all levels have more freedom in the number of alts they create
and play.  Some CWs may have unique additional policies or restrictions
regarding alts in their cultures.  These are to be observed and followed
by any player who posseses an alt in such a culture.  All alternative
characters must be registered under Beleriand's alt list.

See ALTS RULES for more.
==============================================================================
&ALTS RULES
Both players and admins may have their primary character as well as their
alts online at the same time until such a time as the MUSH player database
becomes too large to permit it.  Unless warranted by extreme circumstances,
however, no players are permitted to play both alt and primary in the same
RP scene.  To avoid any potential OOC conflicts of interest, players should
keep their primary and alt characters from crossing IC paths as much as
possible.  Any such conflicts or problems with an alt that the involved CAs
can not resolve will be brought to the attention of the GAs.

See ALTS CREATING for more.
&ALTS CREATING
Players who wish to create an alt character must voice this wish to their
current Culture Warden.  If their CW concurs, the player must then -mail
an official request to the CWs of both their current culture, and the
culture in which they want to create the alt.  Permission to create the
alt character may be denied by either or both CWs.  If both CWs feel the
player is ready for an alt, however, then he or she may create the second
character and join the desired culture.  The CW of the alternate
character's culture will then register the new character so it is
displayed on the list of alts for the MUSH.
&GENDER
==============================================================================
***  Gender and sexism: Out of Character                                
                                                               
We should hope it would go without saying, but just to make it very plain: 
sexism on the OOC level will not be tolerated.             
                                                            
*** Gender and sexism: In Character                    
The world described by Tolkien is basically a medieval fantasy setting.  The 
closest correlaries for real life societies are usually fairly "sexist" 
societies, with men and women occupying fairly distinct niches within their
cultures (for example, medieval societies did not normally have female
warriors).  Hence, a truly "thematic" interpretation would likely leave us
with societies which have strong IC gender-biases, normally leaning towards
male-dominated societies.  Please see NEWS POLICY GENDER 2 for more.
==============================================================================
& policy gender 2
==============================================================================
*) The majority of players tend to play characters of the same gender as
    themselves.  Women players are not likely as a whole to want to be
    limited in their RP here though, or be forced to play a male character
    for the more "interesting" roles.

 *) Regardless of the gender of the player behind a character, it's a lot
    harder to have "interesting" female characters in male-biased societies.

Therefore:

Regardless of the thematic correctness of it, all of our cultures have no
gender bias.  The same IC roles and opportunities are available to male and
female characters.  You can RP a sexist chauvinist if you wish and perhaps
even make a good case that your are being thematic when you do so, but do
not complain if people refuse to RP with you as a result.
==============================================================================
& policy theme
Anything that goes beyond theme, that breaks theme, which changes theme is 
not allowed unless there are VERY special reasons more vital then theme. Mush 
survival is an example...and of course, it depends on what the theme break 
is. It might be allowed if the break is necessary, the reasons for it 
worthy...but that is not often. The game adheres to the sources, see News 
Sources, and will so do by simple fact it is what this game is about. We 
don't break theme unless there's an absolute need to, if you find such a 
reason, then bring the problem and your suggestion to the Global Admins and 
the Theme Council's attention. Now, the doubly tricky thing here is that 
Beleriand has chosen to follow a diverging timeline, which means that we are 
free to do as we want with the world...BUT, we still don't want to loose the 
feeling of the Tolkien works...so, we take guidance from them.
==============================================================================  
& policy conduct
When you log onto BeleriandMUSH, you agree to the following conditions:

You will respect our theme.
You will not attempt to damage the database in any manner, or to use code
   in a way that will cause damage to the database or its host computer.
You will refrain from sexual harassment.
You will agree to the policies as set forth in our NEWS files.

In short, you will behave responsibly and sensibly, and not attempt to
undermine the hard work that the administrators and players have put into
BeleriandMUSH. Repeated violations of the Good Conduct Policy can lead to
expulsion from the MUSH. None of us want that to happen.

There are many MU*s on the Net. Help us make Beleriand one of the best.
==============================================================================
& policy harassment
==============================================================================  
Harassment is not just a Real Life problem. As characters are played by
RL people, many RL problems sometimes occur. Here is our policy on harassment.

 IC vs OOC     As Role-Playing on Beleriand is strongly encouraged, it is to be
               expected that players will act differently when In Character.
               Out Of Character harassment of players as a result of IC
               conflicts is discouraged and a violation of the good conduct
               clause. Talk to a wizard if you experience problems.

 Harassment    As in Real Life, Sexual Harassment will not be tolerated. It is
               not our place to pass judgment or opinion on Tiny Romances or
               Sex. However, if a player says no, it means NO. Also, players
               who connect just to act perverted, crass or use foul language
               will be severely dealt with.
==============================================================================
& policy recycling
==============================================================================  
We use the following guidelines for recycling of People, Places and Things:
  - Characters with an ON-VACATION flag and &VACATION attribute are not
    recycled, until 30 days after their return date have passed.
  - Characters inactive for 60 days or more may be  recycled, along with all of
    their possessions and rooms. If they own an important part of Beleriand
    (beyond personal rooms), those rooms and exits are @chowned to the
    appropriate builder or Wizard.
  - Characters who logged in for only one day, and did not return for 15 days
    are recycled.
  - Characters who logged in but did not finish setting up their character (did
    not join a culture) are recycled after 7 days.
  - Feature Characters who are inactive for 30 days without notice and/or good
    reason may be stripped of their feature.
==============================================================================
& policy ic-ooc (In-Character/Out Of Character)
==============================================================================  
This MUSH is for roleplaying, first and foremost. We recognize, however, that
there will be times when players wish simply to hang out and relax with their
friends. If you find yourself playing Beleriand solely to hold OOC
conversations, however, this might not be the place for you. Our resources are
valuable. Please consider moving your OOC chat to IRC or to a social MU*.

Please do not inflict your OOC conversations upon people who are attempting to
role-play. If one person objects to OOC comments during role-play, EVERYONE
should desist. If you continue to make OOC comments during IC role-play, you
will be breaking the good conduct agreement. In general, keep your OOC
conversations either in the Hangout or other OOC area.

Please see -HELP MODE, -HELP HO, -HELP ME, and NEWS POLICY OOC DESCS.
==============================================================================
& code globals
==============================================================================  
The command -HELP will list the game-wide commands unique to this MUSH. Please
familiarize yourself with these commands, especially -mail. Most of these
commands are either aids to RP or coding, or are designed to provide
information on things around the game or different ways of communication.
==============================================================================

& policy ooc descs
==============================================================================  
Beleriand really isn't the place to store your poetry, your favorite
song lyrics and the like.

If you must have an OOC description, for those rare occasions when you
hang out OOC, please keep it limited to _one_ attribute. Save your other
stuff for a more appropriate net hangout.

IC poetry and songs, of course, we encourage!
==============================================================================
& guests
==============================================================================  
You will often see guests online; you will know them by their name, which is
"Guest" or "BlueGuest" or something similar. Please treat them well, for these

What is a Tp? A Tiny-Plot is a preplanned series of events, a play, where
each player roleplays out his role, his character as each is free to see
fit. We have Spontaneous Rp and we have Tp's, the diffrence is that in the
Tp's, you can plan a part, or all of what is going to happen, you can even
fill in surprises for the players! A Tp can be as large scale as involving a
war between cultures and every event that led up to it, and after it. It can
be as small as the Tp about finding The Lost Kitten...In a way, the whole
Silmarillion is a Tp, a Tp Tolkien wrote with himself. Had prof Tolkien been
here among us, maybe one of us would have played Turin Turamabar and Tolkien
would just have recorded what we did according to our perception of our
character...

Please type 'NEWS PLANNING TINYPLOTS 2' for further information on this topic

&planning tinyplots 2
In a Tp, each player is free to interpret their role in it and the world,
freely, to act freely. That is what gives the Tp that special, individual
touch. BE AWARE though, that -all- plans should be be made known to -all- of
the Tp planners so they know what to expect, surprises can come ICly and to
the players that just partake, but the planners of a Tp should always know
everything, since they might know something you don't. Many Tp's has been
saved from destruction by this fact. Also, the Tp-Coordinator in each
culture, should be given enough information that she/he can approve the Tp
as being thematically sound. If you plan a Tp in a culture, you contact that
cultures admins. Regardless if it's your home culture or one you are
visiting. Letting ppl know what's going on is right and good, see, the Tp
Coordinator does more then only approve your Tp, she/he also knows what Tp's
are being planned so they can fit your Tp in with the whole. She/he can
perhaps even offer some help for you! That is what any admin can do, not
only if there is a lack of a Tp-Coordinator appointed, if you consult them.
Do so. Continue making this game great!

&SPECIES INTRODUCCION
Beleriand supports a number of cultures and species, more then most games on 
the net in fact. Everyone holds an important place in the world of Middle-
Earth and is represented in the game as such. You as a player can join any of 
these cultures that allows the species you have chosen, most places allow 
only one or two species so be careful in choosing species. You may not get to 
go where you first thought... First and foremost on your mind must always be 
the special traits of the species and your character, there are some things 
that separate Sindar elves from Noldor elves, more so, elves from humans and 
so on. Beyond the four normal player races (Elves, Dwarves, Humans and Orcs) 
there are the Restricted Races (RR) that are available (by application, see 
NEWS Restricted Races) to those players who can show and does show the 
greatest will to participate and take part in what goes on in the game, role-
playing skills and a solid knowledge about the RR is also required. A RR 
character is special and often has abnormal stats and abnormal ways of Role-
playing, it is not something lightly taken on. Many demands are placed on 
those.

&ELVES INTRODUCTION
     The Elves are the Firstborn Children of Iluvatar (Q: The Father of All) 
and He gave them being and life within the Halls of Ea, specifically in Arda, 
the World. The Firstborn were created closer in semblance to the Valar, which 
is to say their spirits and bodies are immortal and bound to the Earth to 
thrive or decline as it does. This virtue can be either a blessing or a 
curse, for though the Elves are immune to disease, poison and old age, they 
can be killed by physical means or simply live so long; they become exhausted 
by the burden of life. But, in dying at last, they are not permitted to leave 
Arda, as the Edain may, but instead, are eventually reincarnated to live 
again. So, true rest and peace after a hard existence isn't their Fate, 
according to the will of Iluvatar.

&ELVES INTRODUCTION 2
     By the shores of Cuivienen (Q: Waters of Awakening), the Elves first 
woke from the sleep Iluvatar placed on them. At this time, there was no Sun 
or Moon, but only the Stars created by Varda, the Vala of Light. Therefore, 
the first thing the newly wakened Elves saw were the stars shining above in 
the darkened sky. For this reason, among others, they are called the Eldar, 
or People of the Stars and they revere Varda above all other Valar. But, as 
the first of living things with a speaking voice, they called themselves, 
Quendi, or, the Speakers. This is the general name for Elves on Beleriand, 
the Species name, which can be further divided as will be explained.

     Type NEWS ELVES INTRO 3 to read more.

&ELVES INTRODUCTION 3
     The name 'Eldar', though first given to the whole Species of Elves, 
later came to mean only those who followed the Vala Orome as he led the new 
people on the Great Journey into the West. The History of the Valar and their 
first meeting with the Elves is noted in other NEWS files. For now, we will 
concentrate on the Sundering of the Elves, the reason there are Sub-species 
and the differences between them. 
As noted, the first division of the Elves occurred when the majority followed 
Orome into the West and they retained the name Eldar. It is from this group 
that the characters for role-play on Beleriand are available. The remaining 
group were called 'Avari', meaning, 'the Unwilling' and they, so far, are not 
available for role-play. The Eldar, to add to the confusion, are further 
divided into the Sub-species: Noldor, Vanyar and Teleri. Let's take a look at 
them.

     Type NEWS ELVES INTRO 4 to read more. 

&ELVES INTRODUCTION 4
The Eldar are sub-divided as follows:

NOLDOR: The followers of Finwe. Also called the Deep Elves and the High 
Elves. Their love for gems and beautiful things crafted by their own skill 
eventually led them on the road to pride and arrogance. They are most hated 
by Morgoth, the Dark Enemy of the World.

VANYAR: The followers of Ingwe. Also called the Fair Elves. They are most 
loved by Manwe Sulimo. This is the smallest tribe, all of them having gone to 
Aman. None of the Vanyar are in Middle-Earth, so, are not available for role-
play in Beleriand.

TELERI: the followers of Elwe and Olwe. Also called the Sea Elves and the 
Singers. They were the largest tribe of Elves and are even further divided.

UMANYAR
As noted above, the Calaquendi, or 'Elves of the Light', were the Vanyar, 
Noldor and those Teleri who actually journeyed to Aman. These Quendi lived in 
the Light of the Two Trees and prospered from this radiance. The Moriquendi, 
or 'Elves of the Darkness', never dwelt in Aman, receiving none of this 
beneficence. This group of Quendi included the Nandor, and the Laiquendi; 
and, they, along with the Sindar, also were called, Umanyar, or 'Not of 
Aman'.

        For more information type NEWS SPECIES ELVES
&ELVES DESCRIPTION
     The Quendi are similar to the Edain in appearance, though they are 
usually taller and less bulky than the Secondborn. Since their bodies and 
spirits were made closer in nature to the Valar, they are usually more hardy 
and stronger, as well, though on an individual basis, these qualities might 
vary. Even among the Quendi, there are differences. Elves who went to Aman 
and lived under the influence of the Two Trees, the Light that was before Sun 
or Moon, are even taller than those Elves who never came to Valinor. 
Generally, elves have the normal range of hair and eye color, though these 
hues would be richer and more vibrant than these same traits among Humans or 
Dwarves. Elvish ears vary in form, but generally are more 'leaf-shaped' than 
Human ears. Their eyes are more 'almond' shaped, though not completely, and 
tend to be of the normal colors, as well. Remember, however, that those Elves 
who lived in Aman could have more unique eye color, due to the influence of 
the Light of the Trees. Perhaps brighter colors than those who did not see 
this Light.

&ELVES DESCRIPTION 2
     A more specific description for each Sub-specie of Elves can be found 
under the topics: Noldor, Sindar and Laiquendi. Keep in mind when you are 
considering your description that in all cases, a description that is within 
the boundaries of the theme of the Silmarillion is preferred. For example, to 
describe a Laiquende, one should choose the normal ranges of hair color, such 
as brown, to sandy brown, while avoiding 'green'. Though Laiquende are a type 
of 'Wood Elf', they never had green hair.
For more information, please type NEWS ELVES

&ELVES NOLDOR
     The Noldor are called the Deep Elves and they love all things made by 
hand with skill. They prefer to live in halls of stone that have been 
designed according to their own desires, and to dwell in highlands or hills. 
They were friends and students of the Vala, Aule, and they learned much from 
him concerning crafting and lore. They take delight in languages and scripts, 
embroidery, drawing and sculpting. The Noldor were the first to discover how 
to create gems and are master smiths unsurpassed save by their teacher, Aule.
In appearance, the Noldor are tall, have intense, shining eyes and usually 
have dark or even raven hair. _The Silmarillion_ index states of Finarfin,
"Alone among the Noldorin princes he and his descendants had golden hair, 
derived from his mother Indis, who was a Vanyarin Elf." (Of course Fingolfin
was also Indis' son - apparently, however, golden hair, at least among 
Noldorin 'princes' was peculiar to only Vanyar Elves and some of their 
descendants.). They tend to dress in a courtly manner, or at least in an 
elegant, noble style and are fond of wearing jewelry and gemstones of 
many kinds.

&ELVES SINDAR
     The Sindar are called the Grey Elves or the Elves of the Twilight, since 
they never came to Aman, yet, they have seen the Light of the Trees in the 
persons of Thingol, their King, and Melian the Maia, their Queen. They are 
remnants of the Teleri who lingered on the shores of Beleriand and are 
further divided as those who dwell still on the shores at Falas, and those 
who live in Doriath. They prefer to live in forests or along the coasts in 
structures made from the surrounding region, some of which may actually be up 
in the trees. They were most loved by Osse, a Maia of the oceans and they 
learned shipbuilding and watercrafting and singing from him. Of all the 
Eldar, they have the fairest voices. Under the tutelage of Melian and 
Thingol, they soon surpassed all the Elves that yet remained in Middle-Earth 
in skill and wisdom, until the return of the Noldor.
The Sindar are tall and have a wide range of hair and eye color. They tend to 
dress in a practical manner and are not overly concerned with possessions or 
appearances.

     For more information, type NEWS ELVES LAIQUENDI

&ELVES LAIQUENDI
The Laiquendi are called the Green Elves of Ossiriand and are a remnant of 
the Nandor, who were themselves, a sundered tribe of Teleri who turned aside 
from the Great Journey into the west. They chose to go no farther and 
populated the Vales of the Anduin in the East. After many long years, a part 
of these people chose to continue the journey and they came west into 
Beleriand and settled the Land of Seven Rivers. They were welcomed as kin by 
Thingol and they acknowledged his rule over Beleriand. In appearance, they 
are similar to the Sindar, but less tall and less 'wise'. They are indeed, 
Moriquendi, meaning they have never seen the Light of the Trees. Their homes 
are usually in the trees and hidden. Of all the Eldar, they seem to be 
closest in harmony with the natural world, and their attire and possessions 
have a more 'rustic' appearance as a result.
The Laiquendi are renowned archers and hunters, their skills easily 
surpassing even the more aggressive Noldor in this regard.

&HUMAN INTRODUCTION
Humans are referred to in relation to Elves as the "Second-born", for they 
arose much later in the history of Arda.

Little is known of the course of events the human folk experienced in their 
journey from far to the East of Beleriand, where they awoke as the Sunlight of 
Arien first dawned on Middle-Earth. In the East they had been befriended by 
Avari and Nandor Elves, from whom they learned some speech and music. The 
Edain had also dealt, not always in a friendly manner, with Dwarves in the 
East. But it was not until humans first crossed the Ered Luin mountain range 
where they would later be met and befriended by Finrod Felagund, that their 
lives became wound in with the events of Beleriand, where they would settle in 
various lands.

 After arriving in Beleriand from the East, their fortunes would be closely 
bound with the fate and deeds of the First Age. 

Type  NEWS HUMAN INTRO 2  for further information on humans.

&HUMAN INTRODUCTION 2
The humans known as Edain (or singularly Adan), who are in some places also 
known as 'Fathers of Men' or 'Elf-friends' were the first to enter Beleriand. 
They entered in three groups: First came the Beorians, who would later settle 
in Dorthonion, then the Haladin (who brought with them the Druedain), who 
after nearly being wiped out by Orcs would follow their leader Lady Haleth to 
settle in the Forest of Brethil. The Marachians entered Beleriand last. They 
were the most numerous, and would eventually settle in Dor-Lomin. Many years 
later, another distinct group, the Easterlings, would find their way into 
Beleriand, and at first dwell amongst the folk of Feanor's sons.

&HUMAN BEOR
The first of the three groups of humans who comprise the Edain to enter 
Beleriand were those who followed their chieftain Balan, who later took the 
name of 'Beor' (Quenya: 'Vassal') because of his devoted service to Finrod 
Felagund. It was Finrod who first befriended these people, and settled them 
first in the region named Estolad (Q: 'encampment'), and then in later years 
Dorthonion (Q: 'Land of Pines'), where other Noldorin Elves of the House of 
Finarfin dwelt.

Of their appearance and demeanor, JRR Tolkien writes: "The People of the House 
of Beor were dark or brown of hair; there eyes were grey and keen and their 
faces fair and shapely. Lithe and lean in body, they were long-enduring in 
hardship. Of all Men they were the most like the Noldor and most loved by 
them; for they were eager of mind, cunning-handed, swift in understanding, 
long in memory..."

Type  NEWS HUMAN HALETH  to read about the Second House of the Edain

&HUMAN HALETH
Second of the Houses of the Edain to enter Beleriand were the Haladin. Like 
the Beor who had entered before them, these people also were a loose-knit 
group of clans who apparently had few or no real leaders. Because the Green-
Elves of Ossiriand were unfriendly, the Haladin passed north into Thargelion, 
the country of Caranthir son of Feanor, where for some fifty or sixty years 
they had peace. But Morgoth, seeing that he could not with lies and deceit 
wholly estrange the Elves and Men, was filled with wrath and was determined to 
do Men what hurt he could. He sent an Orc force to assail their settlement, 
and the Haladin rallied together under the leadership of the brave and 
fearless Haldad. He had twin children: Haleth, his daughter, and Haldar, his 
son; and both were valiant in the defense. But Haldad would be slain in a 
sortie against the Orcs; and Haldar too as he came to his fathers defense.

It was left to Lady Haleth to gather the remnants of the Haladin, and make 
Westwards. Briefly they dwelt in Estolad, yet yearning to go forth again, did 
at last make it through hardship and loss to the Forest of Brethil. That land 
was on the western edge of the Kingdom of Doriath, ruled by Thingol, who 
grudgingly bequeathed the land to the People of Haleth by the grace of Finrod 
Felagund.

Type  NEWS HUMAN HALETH  2 to read more about the Folk of Haleth

&HUMAN HALETH 2
As a people, the Haladin were somewhat shorter and broader than the Beor. Yet 
many of them, including the line of Haldad and the Wardens of Brethil, were as 
tall and strong as any of the Edain. In times of need, even their women, of 
great heart and strength, would take arms and fight alongside the men. Their 
excellence at forest warfare strikes fear into the Orcs, who dare come hither 
at great risk, and so the Kingdom of Nargothrond, where Finrod Felagund 
reigns, is further protected.

Type  NEWS HUMAN MARACH to read about the Third House of the Edain

&HUMAN MARACH
The Marachians were the last of the Houses of Edain to enter Beleriand. They 
were the most numerous and best organized, following their chieftain Marach. 
They too would settle first in Estolad where some folk of the Beor and Haladin 
were. Eventually they would make their way to Hithlum, amidst the folk of 
Fingolfin. It was there that Hador Lorindol, great-grandson of Marach, entered 
into the household of Fingolfin, who loved him so that he gave to Hador the 
lordship of Dor-lomin, and into that land Hador gathered his folk and became 
the mightiest chieftain of the Edain.

Of their appearance and demeanor, JRR Tolkien writes: "Many of [Hador's] 
people were like to him, golden-haired and blue-eyed; they were tall and 
strong, quick to wrath and laughter, fierce in battle, generous to friend and 
to foe, swift in resolve, fast in loyalty, joyous in heart, the children of 
Illuvatar in the youth of Mankind."

Type  NEWS HUMAN EASTERLINGS  to read about another branch of humans.

&HUMAN EASTERLINGS
These peoples were diverse in many ways from the Edain who entered Beleriand 
some hundred and more years before them. Tolkien describes them as "short and 
broad, long and strong in the arm, and grew much hair on the face and breast; 
their locks were dark as were their eyes, and their skins were sallow or 
swart. But they were not all of one kind, in looks or in temper, or in tongue. 
Some were not uncomely and were fair to deal with; some were grim and ill-
favoured and of little trust."

It was the folk of Bor who were of those most  honourable and trustworthy, and 
they dwelt in Thargelion and other areas under the rule of the sons of Feanor. 
The tribes of Ulfang and Lorgan, however, would prove treacherous and serve 
Morgoth, though even he would betray them. In later years these people would 
be forcibly settled in Dor-Lomin, after the fall of Hador.

Type  NEWS HUMAN DRUEDAIN  to read about an odd branch of Edain

&HUMAN DRUEDAIN
These were a people of a wholly different kind than any of the Edain. They 
traveled into Beleriand along with the Haladin, and in the Forest of Brethil 
they lived, though they never intermarried with the Edain.

JRR Tolkien writes of them, "To the eyes of Elves and other Men they were 
unlovely in looks: they were stumpy (some four foot high) but very broad, with 
heavy buttocks and short thick legs; their wide faces had deep-set eyes with 
heavy brows, and flat noses... Their features were usually impassive, the most 
mobile being their wide mouths; and the movement of their wary eyes could not 
be observed save from close at hand."

They were excellent trackers with keen senses, and learned in herb-lore and of 
all living things almost to the extent of the Elves, though untaught by them. 
Even more mysterious were their abilities to seemingly perform feats that 
easily could be perceived as 'magic'.

&HUMAN GENEALOGIES
As can be seen by these genealogies, the houses of the Edain intermarried 
often, especially in the lines of their royalty or wardens. Here are the 
family trees of the Three Houses, from their first leaders in Beleriand and 
on.

&HUMAN CURRENTLY
Currently (our game's setting) the Folk of Beor dwell still in Dorthonion. 
Their Lord is Bregolas, a direct descendant of Beor. Their cultural centers 
are in the area about a Rivil Fort and the Lake of Tarn Aeluin. To a greater 
degree than anywhere else in Beleriand, Dorthonion faces the brunt of the 
forces of Morgoth. These hearty folk are glad for the aid given by many of 
their allies.

The Haladin, or the Folk of Haleth as they are often currently known, dwell in 
the Forest of Brethil which they defend steadfastly. The North-South road, 
which passes along their western border, remains controlled by them and for 
the most part denied to the forces of Morgoth. Their leader is Halmir, whose 
position is known as Warden of Brethil. Aid such as they can muster has been 
sent to their distant cousins in Dorthonion.

The Marachians, or the House of Hador as they are currently known, flourish in 
the land of Dor-Lomin, in close friendship to the Elves of Mithrim. For now 
their land is less in peril and they have sent a large contingent in 
assistance of the defense of the central portions of Beleriand.

Easterlings, very few in number, dwell in the lands of Thargelion and Himring, 
in service to the sons of Feanor. The Druedain, numbering only in hundreds, 
dwell in secret somewhere in Brethil and come not into events outside the 
forest.

&DWARVES
Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves were not the direct creation of Iluvatar. 
Aule, the Vala Smith (see NEWS POWERS), in his impatience for the coming of 
the Children of Iluvatar, and yearning for beings other than himself that he 
could love and teach, made the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves secretly, under 
the mountains of Middle-earth. Iluvatar forgave Aule for his presumptuous 
imitation, seeing his sincerity and true desire, and He gave the Dwarves 
spirits of their own and blessed them. Thus they became the Third Children of 
Iluvatar, the children of His adoption. Iluvatar prophesied, however, that 
there would, in time, be strife between the Children of his Choice and the 
Children of his Adoption. Aule set the Seven Fathers to rest underneath the 
mountains of Middle-earth, in far-sundered places, so they might not awaken 
before the Elves.

Aule was well aware of the threat Melkor posed to his creation. He made them, 
therefore, extremely strong, short (four and a half to five feet tall) and 
stocky, resistant to fire, and hardier than any other race. Unswerving and 
proud, Dwarves can not be dominated by another will, and never forget a wrong 
or a debt. As the children of Aule, Dwarves are naturally attracted to 
substances, to the depths of the earth, and to crafts; they are great miners 
and craftsmen and work wonders with stone, metal, and jewels. Their greatest 
flaws are a tendency toward wrath, possessiveness, and gold-lust.

&DWARVES 2
Dwarves live about 250 years and marry about the age of 100. Few women are 
born among them, and these look to non-Dwarves just like male Dwarves. All 
Dwarves wear beards. Dwarven society is male dominated, and their women are 
generally not allowed to go to war (however, see NEWS GENDER POLICY). 
Although like mortal Men the Dwarves do die of old age, like the immortal 
Elves they do not leave this sphere, and are gathered into the Halls of 
Mandos. The Elves, however, claim that the Dwarves have no life beyond Arda 
and the death of their bodies.

In battle the Dwarven hero has a definite advantage. Tolkien says that 
Dwarves are "the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs," and "the most 
redoubtable warriors of all the Speaking Peoples" (Elves, Men). Their 
disadvantage chiefly lies when facing foes greater than Elves or Men: Ents, 
Dragons, Balrogs, and such. Against such foes Men and Elves are generally 
more successful.

The Dwarves call themselves Khazad. The Sindarin equivalent is Hadhod, though 
by far their most common name in Beleriand is Naugrim (Naug singular), or 
related forms. Another Elvish form is Gonnhirrim, meaning Masters of Stone. 
The language of the Dwarves is Khuzdul, Dwarvish, which was taught to the 
Fathers by Aule himself, whom the Dwarves name Mahal.

&DWARVES 3
The Dwarven Fathers awoke not long after the Elves. Dwalin, Father of the 
Broadbeams, and Thrar, Father of the Firebeards, awoke beneath Mount Dolmed 
in the Blue Mountains (the Ered-Luin), which serves as the eastern border of 
the land called Beleriand. To the north of Dolmed the Broadbeams founded 
Belegost, or Gabilgathol in their tongue, the Mickleburg, the Mighty 
Fortress. To the south, the Firebeards built Nogrod (Novrod), Tumunzahar in 
their tongue, the Hollowbold or Hollow Delving.

The remaining Fathers awoke far to the east and south of Beleriand, and come 
little into the tales of these days. Durin, the Eldest, and Father of the 
Longbeards, awoke alone at Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains 
(the Hithaeglir, east from Beleriand). Gundabad still serves as the worldwide 
capital for the Dwarves, who all remain in communication with each other, but 
by our time the chief mansion of the Longbeards is south of Gundabad beneath 
Zirak-Zigil, and the city is called Hadhodrond, or Khazad-dum, the Dwarf-
mansion.

&DWARVES 4
Both the folks of Belegost and Nogrod have pretty good relations with the 
Noldor, as they share with them the reverence for Aule, teacher of the 
Noldor. In particular, the Dwarves of Belegost are staunch friends of all the 
Elves, especially with Thingol of Doriath, for whom they built Menegroth his 
stronghold (for pay). The Broadbeams are also of great help to the Elves in 
battle against Angband, great allies of Maedhros and trustworthy. Azaghal is 
their mighty king.

The Dwarves of Nogrod, however, are less friendly with the Elves than are the 
Dwarves of Belegost. The Firebeards have among them the greatest smiths in 
Middle-earth, including the great Telchar. And while they aided the Elves in 
many great works, including the building of Nargothrond, and often have 
dealings with them, it is only when they themselves can get profit out of the 
dealing. In them may more clearly be seen the prophecy of Iluvatar concerning 
this race, though at our time period there have been no serious quarrels with 
the Elves.

Next: NEWS DWARVES 5
&DWARVES 5
The Dwarves of the two great mansions of the Blue Mountains are called the 
Great Dwarves, as a comparison to the other sub-race of Dwarves in Beleriand: 
the Petty-dwarves. Their tale is a sorrowful one. Exiled from Nogrod or 
Belegost in the far past, perhaps for some dark crimes none can remember, 
they were the first to wander Beleriand. Their dissimilarity with the Great 
Dwarves became greater over the years, for they became smaller, and hunched, 
and wild-haired little creatures. So it is that, when the Elves came into 
Beleriand, they hunted these unknown beasts, for long not recognizing their 
relation to the Great Dwarves of the Mountains. But then they left the 
"Nibin-noeg" alone.

The Moors of the Petty-dwarves, between the vales of Narog and Sirion, was 
the area they particularly settled. There, in the crown of the hill Sharbhund 
(later called Amon Rudh by the Elves), they delved Bar-en-Nibin-noeg. Yet 
their chief mansions were at Nulukkhizdin, the Caverns of Narog. But the 
Elves, wishing to inhabit that place, drove them away, and built Nargothrond 
there. At our time there are not more than a few dozen Petty-Dwarves left, 
taking refuge at Sharbhund. Now, while less great than the Great Dwarves, the 
Petty-dwarves are still very proud and possess their own dignity. They too 
have had their Dwarf-lords. They hate Elves and Orcs alike, and feel very 
little kinship with other Dwarves.

     INTRODUCTION  How JRR Tolkien portrayed these beings

=============================================================================
&ORCS INTRODUCTION
Orcs represent the most numerous of Morgoth's minions and perhaps the gravest 
transgression of the mightiest Vala to Eru, for they were bred (from various 
potential sources) in mockery of the Elves, The Firstborn.

In all of JRR Tolkien's works, Orcs represent the basest, dreadful and most 
offensive and repugnant of (Earthly) human-kind. Rather than just being some 
soul-less essence of 'pure evil' without any vestige of sentient thought, 
they are often thoughtful and sometimes even humourous. Certainly they are 
'bad', and their free will is subjugated to Melkor's dominance under fear of 
his torment. 

Within those bounds, Orcs as players in our game can be very compelling 
characters. In-culture Role-play is as much important for an Orc-player as 
any other player. 

For a list of other topics on Orcs, type: NEWS ORCS 
&ORCS ORIGIN
Orcs were first bred by Melkor (Morgoth) many thousands of years ago in 
mockery of the Elves of Iluvatar. It is well known that Melkor, though 
mighty, did not himself create. Rather he corrupted and twisted what Eru and 
the Vala made.

Long before there were Elves, Orcs, Men or Dwarves, Melkor had corrupted many 
of the Maia to his service. Best known of these is Sauron and the seven 
Balrogs. It would seem plausible that Thuringwethil the Vampire and Glaurung 
Father of Dragons were themselves lesser Maia. So it is likely that once 
Elves awoke and some were snared by Melkor and his minions, that some 
combination of lesser Maia and Elves were the stock of the first Orcs. Later 
humans potentially were too. Now JRR Tolkien himself expressed at different 
times and places variations on this theme of Orcish origin. About all that is 
widely accepted is that Melkor could not have created the Orcs and that 
Dwarves, being by nature resistant to corruption or evil exploitation, were 
not part of Melkor's breeding of the most numerous of his evil minions.

For a list of other topics on Orcs, type: NEWS ORCS 
&ORCS APPEARANCE
Here again, JRR Tolkien was somewhat vague on Orcish appearance. As Orcs 
exist in mockery of Elves, it's logical their appearance would mock beauty 
with hideousness. There are many physical variations as JRR Tolkien describes 
them. Some common traits: Broad, relatively short-statured bodies. Long arms, 
large hands, thick legs. Dark skin, swart faces, slant-eyed, fangs. Of course 
all of these traits need not be exhibited in all Orcs.

In the First Age, Orcs should be strong and imposing in battle. They are 
still under the might of Morgoth. Following Morgoth's defeat at the end of 
the First Age, Orcs are dispersed and not until the Early Third Age, when 
Sauron again masses them and breeds the Uruk-Hai are they again as potent. So 
it's valid conjecture the Orcs of Beleriand are at least as tough as Uruk-
Hai. And that's tough!

For a list of other topics on Orcs, type: NEWS ORCS 
&ORCS CURRENTLY
Currently (our game's setting), the Orcs are part of the Angband culture  
Beleriand's largest. Now that the Siege of Angband was broken, they range wide 
over Beleriand from their northern fortress, many bolstering the already 
horrific forces of Werewolves. 

As providers of much of the needed conflict of our story, in our game players 
with Orc characters are in a high profile position where they may make a 
difference while playing compelling and fun characters. Orc players are 
provided as much opportunity for in-culture RP as with other species. 
Opportunities for advancement include Werewolves, Balrogs, and Dragons.

&RRC
&RESTRICTED RACES
As you may know, Beleriand houses a number of very special species such
as Dragons, Great Eagles, Great Spiders, Werewolves, Ents and Balrogs.
All of these species are restricted due to the fact that any character
(char) in those slots will be much more vital to the game in regards to
being portrayed right (thematically) in role-play (RP). It is not so bad
if an Elf or Orc (non-feature) somehow does make a few mistakes in RP
here and there. But *ANY* of the restricted racial characters (RRC's)
are much more sensitive to theme issues and therefore, have such a great
focus on theme. Their footsteps are literally heard all over the world. 
By their special status in the Silmarillion they have to be portrayed in
that same special way and it is not easy. Still, we want all to have a
chance to get an RRC, provided that there is room for one. We can not
have 40 Balrogs running around for example, since the population of the
MUSH is much less than the Professor's imagination provided for in his
works.

To make an application you must have been on Beleriand for at least four
weeks, thus showing dedication. Your application is to be in the form of
a -mail where you do your best to express a deep knowledge of what
species you want to have a char in. We want to be able to see a good
understanding and an overall good theme knowledge about that species on
your part. Try explaining to us how the species looks or interacts with
others, give examples of it as noted in the texts. The -mail need not be
long but it does need to show you know the history of the species well.
Some RR's may have different demands on them as well. Take for instance
a Great Eagle, this is an intelligent spirit who has chosen bird form,
they come from the Valar, have been here in Middle-Earth since the dawn
of time. Therefore, there is not much in the Silmarillion that they
should not know.

The application is to be sent to the RRC Board (-mail RRC) and to your
Culture Admins (CA's) in order to be evaluated. If you have any Log's of
RP sessions it is a good thing to mention that you have them in your
application because, rest assured, you will be asked to provide them. 
Therefore, it is a good idea to have gathered any and all logs or other
proof of your excellent RP skills and any other things you have done
which can count to your advantage and have that information ready to
provide when asked for it. Please note that the RRC Board may also
conference with your local CA's in order to get a better understanding
of what kind of player your past shows you to be, as well as your
present. The RRC Board will be careful to make sure the RRC's are
players that understand how important their new character is to the
game.

urged to re-apply or take an OOC-RP test where you assume the form and
mentality of the char you want to play. This depends on what was in your
application that was deemed incomplete. If it was unsatisfactory in the
extreme and you failed to prove a good and solid theme knowledge you
will have a hard time convincing the Board to grant you the char. All
RRCs *MUST* have good skills in the RRC's...both in theme and most
importantly, RP. This is in order to assure the MUSH of the best
possible IC feeling. The RRC's are there to give more color, character
and depth to the game...if played right. Keep in mind that *ANYONE* may
apply, but not all that do apply will be accepted.

Once an RRC slot is open for general application, the applications will
be accepted for a period of two weeks. After that two week period, the
period of application will be terminated and the RRC Board will enter
into a week of deliberations concerning those applications receieved. 
therefore, in the interest of brevity and expediency, the whole process
shall take three weeks from start to finish each time a new slot is

Also be sure to bear in mind that there is such a thing as allocation of
a limited number of char's. We cannot allow an overpopulation of RRCs. 
The exact amount will be determined for each race, so beware your
application may be denied on the simple fact there is already enough
char's in the species you have applied for. The spotlight and eyes of
the world are in fact on you if you are granted an RRC, you will be a
important part of the game, almost as important as a Feature (FC). What
you do will be heard and seen, your actions cause more ripples then most
because you have, by the special nature of the RRC, a foundation in the
IC-world which player chars lack. Do not abuse this privilege. It will
become clear to all if you display bad RP, bad ethics or anything else
that is not allowed. By taking on this char you have taken on
responsibilities as well, players will look to you as an example. So you
pay the game back with the best RP possible and the most serious of
dedication to the MUSH. If you live up to the responsibilities placed
on you, you will do fine. Besides, we are all allowed to make mistakes
from time to time, so don't get overly tense about this whole
application process.

If an RRC player shows repeated bad behavior or breaks any ethical
standard, they will be treated just as any other player would be. First
a kind reminder, then a warning, then a more severe warning. Finally, a
serious warning will be issued, and if not heeded then the player has by
not complying with the MUSHes standards, become eligible for forfeiture
of their RRC privileges. An RRC is not special in this way. They are
not to be allowed greater leniency in matters of crime, twinkiness or
any other thing. Goofing off is one thing, there is a difference.

&THORON
&RR THORON 
&EAGLES
&RR EAGLES
The Eagles (Thoron) of Beleriand play a very decisive and prominent role
in Professor Tolkien's literary works. Indeed, this race is mentioned
numerous times and plays a major role in the overall epic. It is for
that reason that player characters belonging to this RRC are clearly
within the bounds of theme on this MUSH. It is also important to point
out that the Eagles of Beleriand are counted among the most ancient of
races and are notably renown as the messengers of Manwe, thus obviously
a noble and goodly race. The eryies of the Eagles as stated in the
texts, are located in the peaks Crissaegrim about the Tumladen Vale. 
Eagles are similar in all regards to a regular eagle except on a much
larger scale. Eagles enjoy the ability of swift flight and keen
eyesight as well as a renown battle prowess. Also, their reputation
seems to proceed them. Thus causing a degree of natural fright in their
enemies. Though there is nothing in any of the texts that could be
found to lead one to believe that they have any mystical abilities aside
from their high intelligence, wisdom and ability to speak.

&GAURHOTH
&RR GAURHOTH
&WEREWOLVES
&RR WEREWOLVES
The Werewolves (Gaurhoth) were introduced into our game as an evil RRC
that would bridge the gap between the Orcs and the Balrogs. That is
clearly thematic as Sauron was a sorcerer closely aligned with
werewolves. He in fact, can take the shape of a werewolf himself and
does so at his discretion. Thus it stands to reason that Sauron would
favor these servants in relation to those others previously stated.
Sauron created the werewolves of Wizard's Isle of which there is a large
number, but that number is not set in the texts. Werewolves are nearly
as intelligent if not as intelligent as humans and can speak in
languages understood by both Men and Elves. They are also able to
mystically hide in darkness. It is uncertain exactly how this is done. 
However, it seems most logical to explain it as either being
exceptionally stealthy or being able to magically manipulate darkness
about themselves but *NOT* to any great degree. They also seem to be
able to create an aura of fear about themselves. Much like one would
naturally expect from a pack of normal wolves for example. In RP, the
characters opposite the werewolf character may choose to react however
they wish to this as it is not an overly powerful ability. The
werewolf's poses should reflect that there is something slightly
mystical in the way it bays that might cause a degree of trepidation.

&GAURHOTH 2
&RR GAURHOTH 2
&WEREWOLVES 2
&RR WEREWOLVES 2
Werewolves have an unclean bite that can cause a bad
infection/poisoning. This 'poisoning' can even affect Elves, though the
degree that it can do so is uncertain (simple illness, incapacitation or
death) and should be left up to the Elf character being mauled. Though
it is clear that it can cause death in humans. Werewolves may be
described as being pretty much any color that the player wishes. They
may also be described as having glowing eyes (though the color of that
glow is uncertain in the texts). They may also be described as being
large (the largest being 58 in. in height at the shoulder). However, in
all other aspects, they should be described as appearing as a normal
wolf.

&VALARAUKAR
&RR VALARAUKAR
&BALROGS
&RR BALROGS
The Balrogs may well be described as the 'fists of Morgoth'. They have
played a major part in every one of the five battles of Beleriand, and
also have hand their hand in the deaths of many an Elf: Feanor, Fingon,
Ecthelion and Glorfindel the most renowned among these. Second among
the throngs of Melko in strength/prowess only to the Dragons they are
certainly a force to be reckoned with, and are thus included among the
RRCs of the MUSH. Balrogs were formerly Maia corrupted by Melkor. Given
the position of Captains of Angband they are a pompous group who control
by fear. Formidable opponents they have slain many a renowned elf. 
Cloaked in shadows they control their fiery nature.

lack of pertinent information to be found in the texts in order to
adequately construct the RRC in question or a degree of ignorance on the
part of the RRC Character that would render it relatively unplayable in
the context of this game.

Type NEWS RR OTHER 2 for more info.

&RR OTHER 2
Trolls shall not be played on this MUSH at this time due to the lack of
inherent intelligence in the character. The player would be able to
pose nothing more then mindless bashing. Therefore it is strongly
suggested that the CAs of Angband be allowed to set scenes that make
mention of the fact that trolls are taking part in battles, etc. But
that the trolls themselves are not actually being played, but rather are
being emitted.

Type NEWS RR OTHER 3 for more info.

&RR OTHER 3
Ghosts and other such 'undead', though sparsely mentioned here and there
and hinted at from time to time in the texts, shall not be played as
RRCs on this MUSH at this time. The reason being that though there is
some *small* amount of text to support the notion that they are present
in this timeline, the information is so scarce as to make it exceedingly
difficult to fashion an RRC for them. If such an occasion may come to
pass whereby an undead is called for to take part in a scene, those
considering such a thing should consult with an appropriate CA (or body
of CA's) for further information and/or permission to do so. The spirit
in question would then likely best be emitted for effect.

=======================================================================
& characters
When you create a character it must fit in with theme, always. The easiest 
way to check this is through the Culture Admins of your culture, they know in 
general what is accepted or not. Some cases may be too tough and the matter 
must be passed on higher up. Still, try and act within the limits of the 
Sources (see Theme Sources) that the game recognizes and uses. Your 
background and history can be made in any way, except the fact it must not 
cross or be greater then that of theme. It's not very good to try and make 
your character more glorious than, say, Beren. Adhere to the theme of 
Tolkien's Middle-Earth and you should do fine, there's quite a lot of room to 
maneuver, if you take the time to be creative. Generally, you should follow 
the outlook of your species and culture...but exceptions have and will always 
be around - let your CA's decide if it's playable or not. In fact, a player 
is in him/herself an exception, above the cut of the Non-Player Characters 
and thus, standing out. There's a huge NPC (Non-Player Character) population
out there, you are just a little bit more visible then they, a special person 
already. Make yourself even more special in acts, words and deeds, make your 
character come alive...alive in the world of Tolkien.
=============================================================================
& cultures
In the Tolkien world there were many places that was worthy of note, on 
Beleriand we have tried to center these into cultures where the different 
homes and for the different factions within the species resides. The cultures 
have been built by dedicated players, great honour to these, that has tried 
and gleaned as much information as possible from the Sources (See Theme 
Sources) available. Sometimes there hasn't been enough and they've had to 
make logical guesses and even create new things. As great a master as Tolkien 
was, not even he could fully and utterly describe every little detail to 
create the world. The builders has had to and must so in even greater extent 
in the future, try and find a reasonable solution to the problems. A way to 
create the things they need without breaking theme. All the cultures has 
their sides, bad and good, depicted in their everyday life...best way to see 
them, is to go there and talk with the players. A culture is nothing without 
the players therein; players are the greatest expression for the 
interpretation of their part of Tolkien's works...
=============================================================================
& sources
First, we follow the information and the wonderful tale in the Silmarillion, 
the book that is the base for our work here. Second, we take guidance and 
support from any other of Tolkien's own works that is related to Middle-
Earth. Third, we pay attention to the notes that were gathered and re-
constructed by JRR Tolkien's kin. Fourth, we look at but weigh carefully 
before we actually do anything, the works of other people that is linked to 
Middle Earth. Such works may contain brilliant things that we can take into 
account without breaking copyrights, if the material is deemed good for our 
purposes then we might take it into account. NEVER is Non-Tolkien material of 
equal worth to Tolkien's own. The basic foundation is with Tolkien, not any 
other author. (Check out Theme Resources for a list of works we've used.)All
of this is taken to account as we follow our diverging timeline, where 
anything can happen really...but we still look at the books for guidance, 
even if we do not create every event as it is in the books. 
=============================================================================
& loopholes 
As great a master as Tolkien was, there are loopholes in the world and it's 
history, this fact is both to our advantage and disadvantage. It is bad for 
in such cases we lack knowledge of how it was intended to be...but on the 
other hand, we get the freedom to act, within limits. We get to fill out the 
empty spaces and make a new link where one was missing. This is generally not 
something one should do casually, think it over, discuss it first with others 
and your CA staff (Possibly the Theme Council)...the solution you come up 
with must be waterproof and solid. It must fit in with everything else in the 
history, no small thing. If such a loophole is found by you, don' t try to 
use it to your own gain, it'll be discovered by others and you'll only be 
suspected. Talk about it instead, something real fun should be possible to 
create out of it in fact! 
=============================================================================
& breaks
This game is all about staying inside theme so Theme breaks are not looked at 
kindly. When and if someone breaks theme it will be investigated unless the 
break was authorized. If it is found that the person or persons making the 
break does so knowingly of the fact that it is wrong, it can result in loss 
of privileges. We do not toy with theme, however, it is one of the lesser 
crimes possible, many a time it's simply a matter of misunderstanding, or 
misconception. There's understanding and leniency for that.(See Theme 
Arbitrators for further information.)
=============================================================================
& arbitrators
Arbitrators (Arb) are our judges, the ones that help govern the game in a 
manner that has been deemed right. They safeguard combat and theme as well, 
at any time you, as a player or admin, have the right to call down a 
arbitrator when you think someone has done something wrong in the issues of 
Theme or Combat. For Ethical crimes, or crimes against the Mush you call down 
a Global Admin (GA's). In either case an investigation and questioning will 
follow, a very careful one. It is impossible to ascertain the truth as an Arb 
or GA unless there is cooperation...and if an Arb or GA is called down 
cooperation is expected! When Arbs/GA's are called, it's a serious matter 
that you yourself were unable to solve on your own. ALWAYS try for peaceful 
means first, try talking it over among the people involved in the case of 
Theme or Combat...there's almost no chance at all of a happy ending once a 
Arb is called. NEVER HESITATE to call a GA if you see Ethical crimes or 
crimes against the Mush, such things will not be tolerated, feel free to 
consult your CA staff (or a GA) for advise on the problem if you are in doubt 
if the matter really is a crime.
=============================================================================
& council
The Theme council is a group of players, Wizzes, Roy's Culture Admins and 
normal players that all has expressed a solid and good knowledge and interest 
in Beleriand. It is the forum, the place where Theme issues are brought and 
decided upon. All Arb's are automatically members of the Theme Council on 
grounds of them being judges in theme twists. What does the Arb's handle and 
what does the Theme council handle? Arb's handle crisis theme issues that 
involve two people or more that can be either disagreeing in a hostile manner 
(not to say they cannot handle non-hostile discussions as well), or whenever 
a solution is demanded at once as is dictated by the situation.  The Theme 
council is there for people to bring stuff to, theme points on which they 
wish to receive an answer to. Many a time are there issues found in Tolkien' 
works that one wants help interpreting or want a final word on how it should 
be. 
=============================================================================
& resources
The game has several players among the admins that are considered good 
authorities on theme, look at -admins/all for information on who does what.
Among the books these people rely on is:

  The Silmarillion
  Morgoth's Ring
  The War of the Jewels
  Peoples of Middle-earth
  Unfinished Tales
  The Lord of the Rings (to a small extent as it deals with
                         a much later time period)
  The remaining books of the History of Middle-earth series insofar
  as they do not contradict the above-mentioned.

The Silmarillion is the ultimate source, since things in especially Morgoth's 
Ring and to some extent in The War of the Jewels do contradict it. 
=============================================================================
& POWERS
In the beginning Iluvatar made the Ainur, the Holy Ones, of his thought, and 
they made a great Music before him. In this Music the World was begun, for 
Iluvatar made visible the song of the Ainur. And many among them became 
enamoured of its beauty; therefore Iluvatar gave to their vision Being. Those 
who desired it arose and entered into the World at the beginning of Time, and 
it is their task to achieve it, and by their labours to fulful the vision. The 
Great among these spirits the Elves name the Valar, the Powers of Arda, and 
Men have often called them gods.

See: 'NEWS POWERS <name>' for more information about a specific Vala.
==============================================================================
& POWERS MELKOR
Mightiest among the Ainur and he to whom had been given the greatest gifts of 
power and knowledge was Melkor. In the powers and knowledge of all the other 
Valar he has a part, but he turned them to evil purposes, and uses his 
strength in violence and tyranny.

Once in the world, Melkor's eagerness turned to jealousy and he was excluded 
from the numbers of the Valar. Desiring to dominate created things and the 
wills of others, Melkor in his envy and malice claimed Arda as his own and, 
foiled in this by Manwe, hindered its completion and corrupted many of the 
Maiar into serving him. In these struggles, the First War, Melkor was at last 
defeated by Tulkas, but Arda was Marred.

However, Melkor soon returned to Arda in the far North. Before the Valar could 
be aware of him he destroyed the Two Lamps, forcing them to retreat to Aman. 
He ruled uncontested in Middle-earth until the Valar, concerned for the safety 
of the Elves, defeated him in the Battle of the Powers and carried him back to 
Valinor in chains, where he served three years in the prison of Mandos. He 
then feigned repentance and was let free in Valinor, where he spread evil lies
and dissention. With Ungoliant, he finally destroyed the Two Trees, and stole 
the Silmarils, the holy jewels filled with the light of the Trees; and escaped 
back to Angband, his stronghold north of Beleriand in Middle-earth.

From Angband Melkor rules his minions, defending the Silmarils against the 
Noldorin exiles. Dismayed by the light of the Moon and Sun and the fierceness 
of the Noldor, Melkor was at first defeated, and for nearly four hundred years 
he has been besieged in Angband. But he spends the time strengthening his 
forces, preparing to break the siege and bring Beleriand and all Middle-earth 
under his dominion.

Melkor's element is Fire. He influences cold, crafts, materiality, earth, Men, 
an Orcs. His symbol is the Iron Crown in which he set the Silmarils; his 
emblem is a field of sable, unblazoned. His colour is none.

Names: Melkor (Q. "He Who Arises in Might;" S. "Belegur"); Morgoth (S. "Dark 
Enemy"); Bauglir (S. "Constrainer); Belegurth (S. "Great Death").
==============================================================================
&POWERS MANDOS
Doomsman of the Valar.
================================================================================
& POWERS MANWE
Manwe and Melkor were brethren in the thought of Iluvatar. The mightiest of 
the Valar was in his beginning Melkor; but Manwe is dearest to Iluvatar and 
understands most clearly his purposes. He was appointed to be, in the fullness 
of time, the first of all Kings: lord of the realm of Arda and ruler of all 
that dwell therein. In Arda his delight is in the winds and the clouds, and in 
all the regions of the air, from the heights to the depths, from the utmost 
borders of the Veil of Arda to the breezes that blow in the grass. All swift 
birds, strong of wing, he loves, and they come and go at his bidding.

Manwe is lord of the Valar, ruling their councils, confirming their deeds, and 
hallowing their artifacts. His throne is set in Ilmarin atop the great mount 
Taniquetil, whence he looks out over all the world.

Manwe is compassionate and wise, but he does not understand evil, being free 
of it. So he was deceived into unchaining Melkor, thus allowing the tragedy 
and glory of the wars of Elves and Men against the Darkness.

Manwe's element is Air. He influences sky, wind, weather, sight, poetry, 
wisdom, birds, and the Vanyar. His colour is blue.

Names: Manwe (Q. "Blessed One"); Sulimo (Q. "Breather"); King of Arda, the 
Elder King, Lord of the West.
==============================================================================
& POWERS VARDA
Varda is the spouse of Manwe. Too great is her beauty to be declared in the 
words of Men or of Elves; for the light of Iluvatar lives still in her face. 
In light is her power and her joy. Out of the deeps of Ea she came to the aid 
of Manwe; for Melkor she knew from before the making of the Music and rejected 
him, and he hated her, and feared her more than all others whom Eru made.

Of all the Great Ones who dwell in this world the Elves hold Varda most in 
reverence and love. They call upon her name out of the shadows of Middle-
earth, and uplift it in song at the rising of the stars.

Varda made the stars, filled the Lamps of the Valar with light, collected the 
dews of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned newer stars and constellations 
in preparation for the awakening of the Elves, hallowed the Silmarils, and 
established the courses of the Moon and Sun.

Varda's element is Light. She influences stars, light of Arda, hearing, and 
insight. Her colour is white.

Names: Varda (Q. "The Exalted"); Elbereth (S. "Star Queen;" Q. "Elentari"); 
Tintalle (Q. "Kindler"); Gilthoniel (S. "Star Kindler"); Lady of the Stars; 
Fanuilos (S. "Ever-white"); Snow-white.
==============================================================================
& POWERS ULMO
Ulmo is the Lord of Waters. He is alone. He dwells nowhere long, but moves as 
he will in all the deep waters about the Earth or under the Earth. He is next 
in might to Manwe, and before Valinor was made he was closest to him in 
friendship; but thereafter he went seldom to the councils of the Valar, unless 
great matters were in debate. For he kept all Arda in thought, and he has no 
need of any resting-place. Moreover he does not love to walk upon land, and 
will seldom clothe himself in a body after the manner of his peers. If the 
Children of Iluvatar behold him they are filled with a great dread; for the 
arising of the King of the Sea is terrible, as a mounting wave that strides to 
the land, with dark helm foam-crested and raiment of mail shimmering from 
silver down into shadows of green. The trumpets of Manwe are loud, but Ulmo's 
voice is deep as the deeps of the ocean which he only has seen.

Nonetheless Ulmo loves both Elves and Men, and never abandoned them, not even 
now when they lie under the wrath of the Valar. Ulmo speaks to those who dwell
in Middle-earth with voices that are heard only as the music of water. For all
seas, lakes, rivers, fountains and springs are in his government; so that the 
Elves say that the spirit of Ulmo runs in all the veins of the world. Thus 
news comes to Ulmo, even in the deeps, of all the needs and griefs of Arda,
which otherwise would be hidden from Manwe.

Ulmo's element is Water. He influences sea, rain, springs, music, and the 
Teleri. His colour is sea-green.

Names: Ulmo (Q. "Pourer, Rainer"); Lord of Waters; King of the Sea.
==============================================================================
& POWERS AULE
Aule has might little less than Ulmo. His lordship is over all the substances
of which Arda is made. In the beginning he wrought much in fellowship with
Manwe and Ulmo; and the fashioning of all lands was his labour. He is a smith
and a master of all crafts, and he delights in works of skill, however small,
as much as in the mighty building of old. His are the gems that lie deep in
the Earth and the gold that is fair in the hand, no less than the walls of the
mountains and the basins of the sea. The Noldor of the Elves learned most of
him, and he was ever their friend. Melkor was jealous of him, for Aule was
most like himself in thought and in powers; and there was long strife between
them, in which Melkor ever marred or undid the works of Aule, and Aule grew
weary in repairing the tumults and disorders of Melkor. Both, also, desired to
make things of their own that should be new and unthough of by others, and
delighted in the praise of their skill. But Aule remained faithful to Eru and
submitted all that he did to his will; and he did not envy the works of
others, but sought and gave counsel.

It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made by Aule, for so
greatly did he desire the coming of the Elves and Men, to have learners to
whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was unwilling to await
the fulfilment of the designs of Iluvatar. But seeing his folly, Aule offered
his creation to his Father, and prepared to destroy the work of his
presumption. But Iluvatar had compassion on Aule, because of his humility; and
gave life to the Dwarves, the children of his adoption.

Aule's element is Earth. He influences the material earth, skill, lore,
crafts, creativity, insight, materiality, the Dwarves, and the Noldor. His
colour is brown.

Names: Aule; the Smith; the Maker (Kh. "Mahal"); the Friend of the Noldor.

& POWERS TULKAS
"Greatest in strength and deeds of prowess is Tulkas, who is surnamed Astaldo,
the Valiant." He was the last of the Vala to come to Arda, lending his great
strength and hardihood to the Vala against the foe Melkor.

Often is Arda filled with his laughter, and he delights most in wrestling and
contests of strength. He runs faster than any living thing on foot, and his
anger when riled passes before him like a mighty wind, scattering cloud and
darkness. His spouse is Nessa, the sister of Orome who is also lithe and
fleet of foot.

"His hair and beard are golden, and his flesh ruddy; his weapons are his hands.
He has little heed for either the past or future, and is of no avail as a
counsellor, but is a hardy friend."

Book of Lost Tales has this to say of where Tulkas lived:
"...[Tulkas] dwelt amidmost of Valmar...His was a house of mirth and revelry; 
and it sprang high into the air with many storeys, and had a tower of bronze 
and pillars of copper in a wide arcade. In its court men played and rivalled 
one another in doughty feats, and there at times would that fair maiden Nessa 
wife of Tulkas bear goblets of the goodliest wine and cooling drinks among the 
players."
==============================================================================
& POWERS NESSA
Nessa is the spouse of Tulkas, and sister of Orome. She is lithe and
fleetfooted. "Deer she loves, and they follow her train wherever she goes in
the wild; but she can outrun them, swift as an arrow with the wind in her
hair. In dancing she delights, and she dances in Valimar on lawns of never
fading green."
==============================================================================
& Arbitrators Internal
This is the procedure that the Archarbs follow whenever a complaint has 
arisen about a Arbitrator. A arbitrator is not allowed to break rules, to 
take advantage of his office and his powers or to abuse player trust in any 
way. A  Arb is breaking trust by judging a case he himself is involved in. 
Whenever such a occasion comes up, please notify one of the four Archarbs 
preferably Nienna first hand, then Thorondor, then Marhir. Please note that 
Tulkas and Marhir for the time being are not active Archarbs but will serve 
in that respect when able to.1, Whenever a Arb is reported to have broken 
the policy we are trying to enforce, whatever the arb did and whoever he is, 
the matter will be looked into. An archarb will investigate and gather facts 
from all parties. Conversations logged.

Type NEWS ARBITRATORS INTERNAL 2  for more info.

& Arbitrators Internal 2
2, The evidence will be discussed among the arch's, usually Nienna,
Thorondor and Marhir. Questions noted.

3, The questions we've come up with will be asked the Arb and the other 
party. Conversation logged.

4, The arch's reconvene and will try and estimate punishment suitable, 
without being partial. NO action is EVER done without at least two archs 
deciding, if there is no second arch available the matter will be postponed 
until one is. The ARB in question is under suspension until that time, the 
arb-status is not removed; we simply expect the arb to honour his suspension 
by doing as told, not to test and not to act with arb authority. Should he 
break the suspension then he'd better have a real good reason for doing so. 

5. Penalty dealt. It will wary based on the crime.


Type NEWS ARBITRATORS INTERNAL 3  for more info.

& Arbitrators Internal 3
We judge each case, by itself, by at least two arch's jointly. (There is a 
motion for it to become three archs minimum to decide on such matters.)  The 
penalties we have right now are; Suspension (This is for minor infractions 
since it doesn't really do anything except give the Arb time to think.) 
Probation (When someone makes a grave error or a misconduct of some sort  we 
can issue a warning and let the Arb go on probation. If he breaks probation 
by doing another mistake, when he certainly should be even more attentive 
then he has proved himself unfit and will be discharged.) Removal (Obvious 
abuse or misconduct. Basically, we don't fire Arbs for making one mistake, 
we fire them for making two, thus showing themselves to be unfit for this 
work.)What does a mistake consist of? A mistake is to do something 
unintentionally. That is hard to prove however, next to impossible. To find 
out if it was by mistake or intent, logs and personal talks are required, 
as well as a good knowledge of an arbs past. Misconduct is something else hard 
to put to words, it is misconduct to teach wrong by intent or to take 
advantage of an arbs position and power. The question comes with the severity
of the misconduct. The crime will warrant the punishment.
